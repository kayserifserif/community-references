<div id="transcript">
<p>And that's how Paleolithic hunting tribes overtook early agricultural civilizations.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That's an interesting answer, Miss Edison.</p>
<p>Is it right? Don't know, don't care.</p>
<p>But so far, you're all getting A's.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Are you sure everyone should get A's? It seems unfair to the people that actually studied.</p>
<p>Throw paper balls at her head until she sits down.</p>
<p>Sitting.</p>
<p>I'm sitting.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>A-pluses for all of you.</p>
<p>Professor Duncan, you are such a great teacher when you're drinking.</p>
<p>Thank you, Darrell.</p>
<p>It's Troy.</p>
<p>Hey, it the man wants to give Darrell an A, let him do it.</p>
<p>Nice shot.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>A toast to the easiest school, the dumbest dean And the ultimate blow-off class: Anthropology.</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Shirley.</p>
<p>Hm? You're not drinking.</p>
<p>Someone is cruising for an A-minus.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I'm with child.</p>
<p>If it's my child, it's okay to have a drink or two.</p>
<p>Chang babies love the sauce, you know? Alcohol and duck.</p>
<p>Zoink.</p>
<p>This is not your child, Chang.</p>
<p>It's Andre's.</p>
<p>How do you know? Because I don't see any locusts.</p>
<p>Besides, a woman knows these things.</p>
<p>Women have a connectedness to their bodies that you would never understand.</p>
<p>You have a booger.</p>
<p>I know, it's part of me.</p>
<p>Hey, can we please do the exam? Question number two: How awesome is it that this class is fake? Yeah.</p>
<p>Here is to never telling the dean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>And that is what Jews do at weddings.</p>
<p>Anthropology.</p>
<p>Lehayim! Professor Duncan, class, this is Mr. Jacobson.</p>
<p>He's a writer who's doing a piece on me for Dean Magazine.</p>
<p>Ah! I know, right? Keep taking your exam.</p>
<p>Don't let my presence distract you.</p>
<p>I'm sort of a father figure to the kids around here for my outside-the-box approach to education.</p>
<p>You know, like that film, Children of the <span class="reference">Children of the Corn</span></p>
<p>What? Proceed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The anthropology final.</p>
<p>Do you know what? I have left the exam paper in my office, but it is a real doozy.</p>
<p>There is an interactive element, a performance component, and I don't wanna tip it, but there may be a lump of clay coming to everyone in the room.</p>
<p>So toodle-Ioo.</p>
<p>Cheerio.</p>
<p>Wowee.</p>
<p>This is a real college.</p>
<p>So after this, we should check out the World Food Festival in the parking lot.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>There are lunch trucks with 18 different nationalities of food.</p>
<p>You know what? Not different, equal.</p>
<p>Equal to whites.</p>
<p>You know what? Better than whites.</p>
<p>I think that sounds like an awesome thing to do immediately.</p>
<p>I bet the reader of Dean Magazine would love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>I'd like to stay here and check out this unorthodox exam.</p>
<p>Oh, Shirley, you okay? Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Just a little indigestion.</p>
<p>I've been having it all morning.</p>
<p>Are you sure it isn't a contraction?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>It's way too early for any of that.</p>
<p>My other two came right on schedule.</p>
<p>Maybe even a little late.</p>
<p>Jordan was in here so long, he came out with a driver's license.</p>
<p>I'm kidding.</p>
<p>That's not true.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Chang babies are always premature.</p>
<p>We gestate fast because we're better at obtaining nutrients.</p>
<p>Some need only eight months, depending on how much of the mother they eat.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, Shirley, that is full of chemicals.</p>
<p>I wouldn't expose your baby to that.</p>
<p>Actually, my doctor said antacid is safe to take.</p>
<p>Let me guess who paid for that study: Big antacid? Shirley, chew on a eucalyptus root and, I know it sounds gross, pig saliva.</p>
<p>It's the same active ingredient as antacid.</p>
<p>They dress it up with a fancy name.</p>
<p>How dare they? Wanna see a movie today? Word.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, why do you do that? Do what?</p>
<p>It's cool.</p>
<p>How? I don't know.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>Well, let me in.</p>
<p>Let me in to the handshake.</p>
<p>I'll give you $ 1000.</p>
<p>Indecent Proposal.</p>
<p>Indecent Proposal.</p>
<p>Woody.</p>
<p>Demi.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>You two gonna fall in love? No.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Tsh.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So have you considered natural childbirth? Are you kidding me? I'll take whatever they got.</p>
<p>Epidural is a proper Christian woman's only chance to get wrecked.</p>
<p>From what I'm told, the real high is the endorphin rush of a chemical-free birth.</p>
<p>I read an article that said some women can actually achieve or, uh, uh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Thank you for the conversation.</p>
<p>I know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>That's not something a woman does on her child's head.</p>
<p>But --</p>
<p>Listen, backseat birther, Shirley's on her third kid.</p>
<p>She doesn't need a slacker with two one-eyed cats governing her body.</p>
<p>First of all, together, my cats can do anything.</p>
<p>Secondly, you're disqualified from this conversation the moment you decided to grow a wang.</p>
<p>I regret nothing.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the airhead you're gonna knock up at 70.</p>
<p>You're gonna be sitting in the waiting room playing solitaire while a life is created -- oh, and you're gonna squat in a babbling brook and a beautiful star child is gonna slide out on a ray of sunshine while your cats each half watch, because you're so natural.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Can someone please get every mop on campus? Um, did you break water? Is that broken water? That's broken water! Chang baby! Just nice and easy.</p>
<p>Careful.</p>
<p>Oh, Father, God Almighty, this isn't happening.</p>
<p>It's too soon.</p>
<p>I don't want my baby's first memory to be Star-Burns.</p>
<p>Oh, goodness.</p>
<p>Okay, this is not a big deal.</p>
<p>Wait, I mean, it is a big deal.</p>
<p>It's just not a big bad deal, it's a big good deal.</p>
<p>If I could have everyone's attention We'd like not to have your attention.</p>
<p>Okay, give me your attention.</p>
<p>This student is having a baby.</p>
<p>What am I talking about? You already know.</p>
<p>Okay, here's what it is.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go get my Prius, I'm gonna pull around the back and I'm gonna drive her to the hospital.</p>
<p>I drive a Prius, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Dean, go! Dean gone.</p>
<p>Can you please call Andre? He's "Sugar Boots" in my phone.</p>
<p>That hurts, Shirley.</p>
<p>Oh, I'll get it, because I am here for you.</p>
<p>We came so close to having one class that wasn't all about them.</p>
<p>Remember when they took that trip on St. Patrick's Day? God, that was a good week.</p>
<p>This has got to be a Chang baby.</p>
<p>Changs are never born in hospitals.</p>
<p>More like taxicabs, hardware stores, bank lines, sewers.</p>
<p>My nephew Jin was born on a treadmill at Bally Total Fitness.</p>
<p>Twenty-percent incline.</p>
<p>Sugar Boots says he'll meet us at the hospital.</p>
<p>Now, can somebody do something about him? I'm saying, nobody needs to freak out.</p>
<p>A Chang is hearty to the core.</p>
<p>We come out healthy.</p>
<p>That's why there's a billion of us.</p>
<p>Ever try Googling me? Can't be done.</p>
<p>Ben, you have to stop freaking her out.</p>
<p>Hey, show me some respect.</p>
<p>I might be that child's estranged father.</p>
<p>Well, what's it gonna be? What? I wanna buy the rights to your handshake.</p>
<p>We have a deal? We're about to take Shirley to the hospital.</p>
<p>This is not the time.</p>
<p>Oh, it's the time.</p>
<p>According to my watch, it's 1000 o'clock.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So how does it work? I don't know, we just do it when one of us says something awesome.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Betty Grable.</p>
<p>I said, "Betty Grable.<span class="reference">Betty Grable</span>No.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p><span class="reference">Betty Grable</span>ney, whore.</p>
<p>Who's Betty Grable? Yeah, that's the stuff<span class="reference">Betty Grable</span>e deep breaths and relax.</p>
<p>Where is the dean? Oh, my God, everything's wet.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Oh, That's okay.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>That's okay because it is natural.</p>
<p>It's natural.</p>
<p>Are you uncomfortable, Britta?</p>
<p>You wish.</p>
<p>Ooh! Okay.</p>
<p>Four hundred, 500.</p>
<p>It's like a million bucks in dog dollars.</p>
<p>Word.</p>
<p>What happened? Something's off.</p>
<p>It's like buying candy from a baby.</p>
<p>What did you do? You ruined it.</p>
<p>Give him back the money.</p>
<p>No, no, no, the money doesn't matter anymore.</p>
<p>Once you've sold something out, you can't get it back.</p>
<p>You didn't even like our handshake.</p>
<p>I hated it.</p>
<p>Now it's gone.</p>
<p>You two are dumber than Jackie Coogan.</p>
<p>He divorced Betty Grable.<span class="reference">Jackie Coogan</span>ed our special<span class="reference">Betty Grable</span>ith his blood money.</p>
<p>Now we can't get the magic back.</p>
<p>Holy crap, you two, for real? Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about your handshake.</p>
<p>A baby is coming out of Shirley's vagina 2 feet from us.</p>
<p>Her contractions are six minutes apart.</p>
<p>So unless her cervix is dilated more than 8 centimeters, we have time to get her to a hospital.</p>
<p>I delivered a baby earlier this year.</p>
<p>Where was I when that happened? I don't know, off in the background.</p>
<p>Did you pull your car up? Uh, no.</p>
<p>It's been overturned.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay, look, I don't wanna alarm anyone, but the World Food Festival has taken a dark turn.</p>
<p>I guess some national ethnicities don't play nice with others and things have turned into a bit of a race kerfuffle.</p>
<p>You mean "riot"? Let's use "kerfuffle" for now, okay, Mr. Winger? Oh, God.</p>
<p>I was just trying to feed hungry foodies.</p>
<p>I'm going to call an ambulance.</p>
<p>There's ambulances out there.</p>
<p>They're overturning those too.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn't even know there was a difference between North and South Korean barbeque.</p>
<p>I mean, M*A*S*H lasted longer than that war.</p>
<p>Get over it.</p>
<p>Am I right? Don't print that.</p>
<p>Let's just quit jotting.</p>
<p>Quit - stop writing! because of a race kerfuffle.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Lake Wobegon days! Abed, what do we do? Shirley, pretend I'm saying this in a soothing, non-robotic voice.</p>
<p>We won't make it to the hospital.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have this baby at a hospital with my husband, the father of my baby.</p>
<p>Unless that father is me.</p>
<p>In which case, what you need to do is elevate your legs over your head while facing the northeast corner of the room.</p>
<p>But try not to look at the door, that's bad luck.</p>
<p>Chang babies are very superstitious.</p>
<p>Also, if you can visualize a rabbit riding a dragon it'll increase his chances of winning lotteries.</p>
<p>Ben, corner.</p>
<p>Listen, Shirley, we're having the baby right here, right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Get every blanket and coat you can find.</p>
<p>Anything soft for Shirley to lie on.</p>
<p>Annie, call Andre and tell him to meet us here.</p>
<p>What can I do? Stop rubbing her shoulders.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Being natural.</p>
<p>Jeff, help me move Shirley to the ground.</p>
<p>All right, just stand right here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Troy, blankets.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just need to take a look and see how far along you are.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable with you taking a tour of my nethers.</p>
<p>I'd prefer if it was one of the girls.</p>
<p>I can do it.</p>
<p>I can do it.</p>
<p>I'm good at looking.</p>
<p>I am here for you.</p>
<p>Okay, what do I do? Look and see if the baby's head has reached the cervix.</p>
<p>No problo, Rob Lowe.</p>
<p>I take it the head has reached the cer<span class="reference">Rob Lowe</span> God.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Not to worry.</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens all the time.</p>
<p>Are a lot of babies born in classrooms? Well, a lot more are conceived.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>No, Paul, that's off the record.</p>
<p>And not true.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Gotta go.</p>
<p>Due to a conflict of genitals I've been disqualified from delivering Shirley's baby.</p>
<p>I'm gonna walk you through it.</p>
<p>I can't deliver a baby.</p>
<p>I'm not prepared.</p>
<p>I need to take a class, shadow a nurse, or at least have my mom hug me first.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>I'm seeing spots.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord, my Lord! Why are you doing these things to me? How have I failed you? Oh! Someone's gotta calm her down.</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>Shirley, look at me.</p>
<p>Look at my face.</p>
<p>Connect with me.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha! What in the hell?! I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Chang! Where's Chang? What's up, baby? You said Chang babies all come this way? Yup, like a bullet from a gun.</p>
<p>And they're all okay? Hell, yeah.</p>
<p>More than okay.</p>
<p>Super babies.</p>
<p>Seven generations of little scrappers born in the worst conditions you can imagine.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>My cousin slid out feet first in a Pickle Barrel.</p>
<p>My uncle was born during rainy season in a Mongolian sheep pasture.</p>
<p>My brother, born under a crowded noodle bar while my grandfather finished his shrimp.</p>
<p>Nothing can stop us.</p>
<p>Not the hurricanes, not the communists, not the feds, not the Girl Scouts.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Get in there.</p>
<p>Me? Forget it, I'm the worst.</p>
<p>Well, that's a discussion for a different time.</p>
<p>Britta, there is something in you that wants to take care of people so bad that you'll do it until you puke.</p>
<p>That's what Shirley needs right now.</p>
<p>Are you saying I'll be a good mom? Heh, heh, what? No.</p>
<p>Man, you will really force anything, won't you? Just get in there and force that baby out of Shirley.</p>
<p>Step aside, people.</p>
<p>Britta for the win! Get out of my way.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm ready.</p>
<p>Abed, walk me through this.</p>
<p>Okay, at each contraction, you need to tell Shirley to push.</p>
<p>That's it? Don't tell any doctors I said this, but the bus pretty much drives itself.</p>
<p>Who is the bus in this scenario?</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Bring it on.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>Come on, Shirley.</p>
<p>The head is out! Now, feel around the neck for the umbilical cord.</p>
<p>There's no cord.</p>
<p>I think that's a good thing.</p>
<p>I am nailing this.</p>
<p>You're doing great too.</p>
<p>Chang, more stories.</p>
<p>Okay, so in World War II, a lot of us were rounded up in labor camps, mining mostly.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Changs were born underneath the earth.</p>
<p>Most spent their first five years underground.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm here.</p>
<p>Oh, Andre.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hi, baby.</p>
<p>It's gonna be all right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ma'am, we can take it from here.</p>
<p>Guys, I got it.</p>
<p>I'm in the zone.</p>
<p>Come on, Shirley.</p>
<p>Come on, Shirley.</p>
<p>Push, push, push.</p>
<p>Push it.</p>
<p>Push it.</p>
<p>Here it comes.</p>
<p>It's Baby Greendale.</p>
<p>You guys don't have to name it that.</p>
<p>I don't claim that power.</p>
<p>I'm merely the deliverer.</p>
<p>Britta, focus.</p>
<p>Oh, doy.</p>
<p>Okay, come on, Shirley.</p>
<p>Push! Push! Push! Oh, it's a boy! And it's also a black person.</p>
<p>Not that that's important.</p>
<p>Are you sure it's yours, baby?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It's definitely his.</p>
<p>I never told you this part, but all Changs are born with tails.</p>
<p>You kind of dodged a bullet there.</p>
<p>Did that just happen? It's back.</p>
<p>It never left.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>We did it, Sugar Boots.</p>
<p>No, you did it, baby.</p>
<p>Congratulations, sir.</p>
<p>After a fierce campaign, I happily concede this baby to you.</p>
<p>Pretty classy of me.</p>
<p>Thank you, Chang.</p>
<p>Couldn't have done this without you.</p>
<p>No bigs.</p>
<p>Andre? Yeah? I think I wanna name him after Ben.</p>
<p>What? Hm? Really? Really? Yeah, I mean, you may not be his father, but you helped bring him into the world.</p>
<p>All right, well, we'll have our own little baby Ben Bennett.</p>
<p>Ben Bennett? Oh, damn.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that's fine.</p>
<p>Ben Bennett.</p>
<p>Hi, Ben Bennett.</p>
<p>Oh, look, he said "Chang." </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, he didn't.</p>
<p>See? Nothing to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you believe that's how we come into this world? Screaming, crying and covered in crap.</p>
<p>Then somewhere along the lines we get it into our heads that we're destined for greatness.</p>
<p>We are.</p>
<p>I just yanked a little dude out of my friend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess we passed anthropology.</p>
<p>Look at how teeny his hands are.</p>
<p>They're so little.</p>
<p>His fingers are like Good & Plenties.</p>
<p>I know, I wanna eat them.</p>
<p>Which is lame.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>This has been quite a day.</p>
<p>You can expect a cover story in the next issue.</p>
<p>In a good way? Like, an article about what a good dean I am? Absolutely.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I am a good dean.</p>
<p>I am a good dean! Ha-ha-ha! Whoo! Are you sure you wanna do this? People do it in movies, but there are real-world consequences.</p>
<p>I know, but if we take that test today, we are definitely going to fail it.</p>
<p>Okay, let's do it.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing? Cancel school today or we tell everybody about this.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p></p>
