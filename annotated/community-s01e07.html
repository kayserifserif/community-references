<p>As you know, all faculty at Greendale are required to give extra credit to students who organize academically-related events during what would otherwise be known as our "free time."</p>
<p>No student in any department has ever exercised this option until now.</p>
<p>Tonight, in the library, I will be hosting a Día de los Muertos party.</p>
<p>Just relax, just relax.</p>
<p>Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is sometimes referred to as Mexican Halloween.</p>
<p>Which is actually quite offensive to people familiar with Mexican Halloween as a sexual position.</p>
<p>At any rate, if you show up, you get extra credit.</p>
<p>Me, I don't even get paid.</p>
<p>See you tonight.</p>
<p>Um, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Most of you responded to my e-vite, but some of you remain evasive, so…</p>
<p>Count me in.</p>
<p>This is my first college party.</p>
<p>I got some tequila, and I just rented Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj, and look.</p>
<p>Shirley, you took off your wedding ring.</p>
<p>My husband's been gone for six months.</p>
<p>So I think it's time for me to embrace being single.</p>
<p>Message received.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting to hear from Jeff and Pierce.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought I shot you a response from this pocket phone here.</p>
<p>Access e-mail.</p>
<p>You're not going to Annie's party? Oh, I have a conflict.</p>
<p>It conflicts with the enjoyment of my life.</p>
<p>I cannot figure out the voice command part of this thing.</p>
<p>It's like I'm my mother.</p>
<p>Calling mother.</p>
<p>What? Speaking of enjoying life, I don't wanna beat a dead horse here, but are you sure you don't see anything non-platonic ever crystallizing between us? I'm sure.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Because one of my professors is really hot.</p>
<p>And I wanted to give you first right of refusal.</p>
<p>Hello? Pierce? Mom? How's school going? Are you popular? I am headed through a tunnel right now.</p>
<p>Wrong number.</p>
<p>Has that boy Jeff stopped teasing you? How's your Canadian girlfriend? I saw your father's ghost again.</p>
<p>He's still angry.</p>
<p>The Bernoulli distribution is the number of successes in a sequence of independent yes-no experiments.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>For the quiz Monday brush up on chapters three and four.</p>
<p>Bernoulli's one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Little known fact, statistics were not his only love.</p>
<p>He's famous for his French sauce used on meat and poultry.</p>
<p>That's béarnaise.</p>
<p>We may need to settle this at a restaurant.</p>
<p>That's cute.</p>
<p>A little aggressive.</p>
<p>But as a busy, confident woman of authority I'm attracted to men who take charge.</p>
<p>You being sarcastic or am I nailing it? You were nailing it until you had to ask.</p>
<p>Oh, damn it.</p>
<p>Starting over.</p>
<p>Hey, you in the skirt, date me.</p>
<p>I'd like to, Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>You're tall, dress nice.</p>
<p>I've graded enough of your tests to know I'd never feel mentally inadequate.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Only problem, I don't date students.</p>
<p>You know, if you agree to go--</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Awkward.</p>
<p>How small is this campus? Bastard.</p>
<p>It's fine, I don't care.</p>
<p>It's disgusting the way men behave.</p>
<p>You ever see that <span class="reference">Katherine Heigl</span> movie poster, where Gerard Butler had that heart over his wiener? That resonated with me.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>But just to repeat, I don't care what Jeff does.</p>
<p>Bastard.</p>
<p>I'm barely a student.</p>
<p>I'm older than you, I drive a Lexus.</p>
<p>I saw <span class="reference">Ghostbusters</span> in the theater.</p>
<p>Look, my gums are receding.</p>
<p>It's uncanny how many of my buttons you're finding, but I have a personal rule about this and I stick to it.</p>
<p>Have a cup of coffee with me, I can change your mind.</p>
<p>I know you can.</p>
<p>That's why you're not getting the chance.</p>
<p>Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo.</p>
<p>Are you coming to my party? I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.</p>
<p>Then I can mark you down as definitely being there from 7:00 sharp until question mark? Here's the thing--</p>
<p>No, here's the thing.</p>
<p>I am putting my foot down, do you understand? I am being assertive, and I am making eye contact, and it is achieving results.</p>
<p>Trying to get formidable with me? It worked on Pierce.</p>
<p>Infomercials work on Pierce.</p>
<p>Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay? If you show up, it will be the first party I host where everyone doesn't say they need to get home in time for the news.</p>
<p>This won't work.</p>
<p>The last time you did this, I saved a vial of your tears.</p>
<p>And I've been slowly building up an immunity.</p>
<p>I was so unpopular in high school, the crossing guard used to lure me into traffic.</p>
<p>This party is a second chance at being hip, cool, laid-back.</p>
<p>Look, I will come to your party.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I'm putting you down for two bags of ice and a sleeve of paper cups.</p>
<p>Taking a pill? Yes, I am.</p>
<p>"Xenolovaden."</p>
<p>My grandpa took that around your age.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Helped him with his going problem.</p>
<p>By the time Grandpa got up in years, his memory wasn't great.</p>
<p>He'd mix the wrong pills.</p>
<p>You know how old people are.</p>
<p>Heard stories about it.</p>
<p>One time he started hallucinating and ran down the street with no pants on, which in the Gaza Strip is considered a real party foul so you should probably be careful.</p>
<p>Look, I really don't need your advice, and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>"Pantsless grandpa."</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Scary.</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Britta, you look adorable.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I hate when women use Halloween as an excuse to dress up like sluts, you know? Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, everyone.</p>
<p>I think we can begin.</p>
<p>I've got everyone's personalized cookie tombstones, por tradición.</p>
<p>And, in a few minutes we're going to start the Dance of the Dead, La Danza de los Muertos.</p>
<p>You don't have to keep doing that.</p>
<p>Party on.</p>
<p>Nice of you to be here, I'm sure you'd rather be out with your hot professor.</p>
<p>Well, it's funny.</p>
<p>I enrolled here as a selfish loner.</p>
<p>But you and the group have given me a crash course in friendship.</p>
<p>She blew you off, huh? She's grading papers.</p>
<p>Professor Slater? She's not grading papers, she's at the faculty party in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Oh, look.</p>
<p>It's the eavesdropping matador.</p>
<p>Are you saying my people are sneaky? What? There is a storm building on the horizon, but you and I will save the night.</p>
<p>Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots.</p>
<p>Predictable but appetizing.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Can I ask you something that I always wanted to ask real <span class="reference">Batman</span>? Am I good-looking? You're a very attractive young man.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Let's get this party started.</p>
<p>Who are you? I am <span class="reference">The Beastmaster</span>.</p>
<p>From the movie, Beastmaster.</p>
<p>What rock have you been living under? What are you going as? A gay douchebag? Just kidding.</p>
<p>Nice one.</p>
<p>I'm not much of a costume guy.</p>
<p>You're not much of a liking-ladies guy either.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Body blow.</p>
<p>Is that liquor? Hello.</p>
<p>Here's your drinks, mates.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thanks, Urkel.</p>
<p>I'm Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Really? What up, Urkel? Hey.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What are you taking? Huh? Oh.</p>
<p>You know, the usual cool stuff.</p>
<p>I've got ludes, dreamers, Johnny Boys.</p>
<p>Tell you what, I'll, I'll trade you one of mine for two of yours.</p>
<p>I don't know, Star-Burns, I'm, oh, sorry.</p>
<p>I thought I was dealing with the Beastmaster.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Who said you weren't? Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Saddle up, fruit pie.</p>
<p>Don't mind if I do.</p>
<p>May I? Here, take this.</p>
<p>Give anyone that shows up their stupid credit.</p>
<p>You going to the faculty party? Make me your plus one.</p>
<p>Give it up, Winger.</p>
<p>Professor Slater doesn't date students.</p>
<p>Or married Asians who drive mopeds.</p>
<p>I'll give you 20 bucks.</p>
<p>I'll bring the hog around.</p>
<p>Okay, it's time for the Dance of the Dead.</p>
<p>Everyone form a circle.</p>
<p>Lights.</p>
<p>Music.</p>
<p>Is it under genre or on a specific play list? Hey, man, what'd you slip me? I keep grinding my teeth and I wanna kiss everybody.</p>
<p>What did you slip me, man? My heart stopped racing and I can't pee.</p>
<p>Now, for the first dance, I would like to invite a very special guest to the floor.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger? Jeff? Where's Jeff? Please slow down.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Stop crying, Winger.</p>
<p>Watch it! Is Jeff gone? You know, I'm gonna go.</p>
<p>I don't wanna miss the news.</p>
<p>News.</p>
<p>He just stepped out.</p>
<p>He's gonna be right back.</p>
<p>He's going to the faculty party.</p>
<p>To be with Professor Short Skirt? We hate her.</p>
<p>No, it's not about her, Shirley.</p>
<p>I can't believe that Jeff would do this to Annie.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, it's about Annie.</p>
<p>We should go find that bitch's car and snap off her antenna.</p>
<p>It's like high school all over again.</p>
<p>Everyone's leaving.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>I can do this all night.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>There you go, pretty lady.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? Showing you my non-student side.</p>
<p>I have to admit, this outfit is doing it for me.</p>
<p>I may or may not have been deflowered by a junior rodeo champion.</p>
<p>You remind me of my first time too.</p>
<p>You lost your virginity to <span class="reference">Robin Hood</span>? No, with an attractive woman at a party.</p>
<p>We seem destined to repeat history.</p>
<p>I told you, no students.</p>
<p>It's unseemly.</p>
<p>I go out with you, you tell your friends.</p>
<p>What friends? I have no friends, I hate everyone here but you.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? What are you doing here? You should be over at the library with Annie.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Yippee ki-yay.</p>
<p>Thought you weren't a costume guy.</p>
<p>Had to have one to get in, squirrel.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So where did you get it? I wouldn't think any costume stores would be open this late.</p>
<p>I don't know what you're getting at.</p>
<p>The words you're looking for are, "I own a cowboy outfit." </p>
<p>And it is tight too.</p>
<p>Did you buy it like that? Your toy gun to my head, I'd say yes.</p>
<p>Hi, Michelle Slater, PhD.</p>
<p>Britta Perry, GED.</p>
<p>Oh, are you a classmate of Jeff's? When you say classmate, it sounds like we take naps together and eat paste.</p>
<p>What's great about community college is is that a lot of the students are as mature as the teachers.</p>
<p>Jeff, you must return to Annie's party.</p>
<p>She's feeling unpopular.</p>
<p>Jeff, Pierce took something and he is tripping balls.</p>
<p>He's touching people and dancing weird.</p>
<p>It's like <span class="reference">Grumpy Old Men</span>, but not hilarious.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Guys, I'm at a grown-up Halloween party, all right? You're all being unseemly.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>How are we unseemly? Why is Urkel ripping the antenna off Professor Slater's car? That's right, Professor Slim Calves.</p>
<p>This is what you get when you steal Jeff from a good woman.</p>
<p>No, Abed.</p>
<p>Is he meowing? Yeah.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>I want you guys out of here.</p>
<p>Britta, I don't care about your high school soap opera.</p>
<p>Abed, you're not <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>Pierce, Pierce, Pierce.</p>
<p>Stop grinding on the Women's Studies department.</p>
<p>You are too old to be tripping.</p>
<p>I'm old? What do you mean old? Whose hands are these? Stop me.</p>
<p>Way to go.</p>
<p>I know I'm not <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>You could try not being a jerk.</p>
<p>She's pretty hot.</p>
<p>Well, where were we, little doggie? Unseemly.</p>
<p>Yeah, crap.</p>
<p>Shirley? Shirley? This is Professor Robin Hood's office.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Putting this hose in her desk.</p>
<p>You turn the water on.</p>
<p>Why? To teach that long neck, weave-having bank teller she can't steal another woman's man, that's why.</p>
<p>Uh, I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I think some of what I just said may have more to do with my situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, the long neck, weave-having bank teller didn't feel universal.</p>
<p>My ex-husband came by this morning, and he asked for his ring back.</p>
<p>It was his mother's, and he wants to give it to his new girlfriend.</p>
<p>Shirley, that sucks.</p>
<p>The best thing that ever happened to me was him leaving.</p>
<p>I just always thought he'd come crawling back, and I'd get to tell him to go to hell.</p>
<p>He couldn't even give me that.</p>
<p>You know what the crazy thing is? Everything you've done tonight? It's like I was too proud to admit I was hurt, so I had to pretend that you were.</p>
<p>I totally get that.</p>
<p>I feel better now.</p>
<p>Let's go check on Annie.</p>
<p>Can you believe I targeted this poor lady? Look at all these awards, I bet she's nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nice and pretentious.</p>
<p>Pierce, are you okay? Hey, man, what's going on? You have a full-on erection.</p>
<p>Just relax.</p>
<p>Relax, man.</p>
<p>Just relax.</p>
<p>Just relax, okay? You are too old to be tripping.</p>
<p>You're going to die.</p>
<p>You are too old to be tripping.</p>
<p>Tell me about The Beatles, Pierce.</p>
<p>Tell me about Woodstock and sputnik, Pierce.</p>
<p>Do I feel a breeze here? Because someone just struck out.</p>
<p>She blew you off too, Chang.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Is that what you have to fall back on? Look at me, bro.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>I've got the body of a fifth grader, okay? If I was working with what you've got, she'd be at the Comfort Inn right now giving me a Mexican Halloween.</p>
<p>It's this campus.</p>
<p>It feeds on my coolness.</p>
<p>I got no moves anymore.</p>
<p>Moves? Everything's a game to guys like you.</p>
<p>I know one move I bet you've never tried in your life.</p>
<p>What is it? Please sleep with me.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Pretty please.</p>
<p>I'm so lonely.</p>
<p>I haven't slept with anyone in a very long time, and you're so good-looking.</p>
<p>Please do me the favor of having sex with me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Stay three steps behind and promise you won't tell anybody.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>Everybody stay out of the library.</p>
<p>Pierce, it's okay.</p>
<p>Come out of there.</p>
<p>No, I'm not ready to die.</p>
<p>You're not gonna die.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>Just keep walking.</p>
<p>Don't make eye contact.</p>
<p>Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.</p>
<p>Pierce is freaking out.</p>
<p>You're the only one that can help.</p>
<p>What makes you think that? Is Jeff there? He's the only one who can help.</p>
<p>He says he's gonna kill himself but he doesn't want us to call 911 because he doesn't wanna get in trouble for taking drugs.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm doing this.</p>
<p>I, uh, I think I have to say good night.</p>
<p>Are you, like, a court appointed guardian for these people? No.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Um, they're my classmates.</p>
<p>Good night, Jeff.</p>
<p>Loser.</p>
<p>What in the Pink Floyd? I'm gonna crush myself to death with desks and tables, Jeff.</p>
<p>Is that a death befitting a Beastmaster? I never saw Beastmaster, I just wanted to be cool.</p>
<p>I'm coming in there, Pierce.</p>
<p>Those floating Mexican skeletons were right.</p>
<p>My life is over.</p>
<p>Well, when we go to floating skeletons with our problems, we get what we pay for, don't we? I'm old, Jeff.</p>
<p>Pierce, I don't know how you spent the first 60 years, but I know in the last two months, you've probably doubled the national average for amount of life lived per lifetime.</p>
<p>Well, I do have a young African American friend.</p>
<p>Yeah, and more importantly, you're dressed like a gladiator in a desk fort that you built during a bad trip.</p>
<p>If life is just a series of ridiculous attempts to be alive, you're a hero to everything that's ever lived.</p>
<p>Yeah? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><span class="reference">Batman</span>? Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you staying for the party? If I stay there can be no party.</p>
<p>I must be out there in the night, staying vigilant.</p>
<p>Wherever a party needs to be saved, I'm there.</p>
<p>Wherever there are masks, wherever there's tomfoolery and joy, I'm there.</p>
<p>But sometimes I'm not because I'm out in the night, staying vigilant, watching.</p>
<p>Lurking, running, jumping, hurdling, sleeping.</p>
<p>No, I can't sleep.</p>
<p>You sleep.</p>
<p>I'm awake.</p>
<p>I don't sleep, I don't blink.</p>
<p>Am I a bird? No.</p>
<p>I'm a bat.</p>
<p>I am <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>Or am I? Yes, I am <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween.</p>
<p>I'm <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>You sound like Cookie Monster.</p>
<p>I'm <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>That's <span class="reference">Batman</span>.</p>
<p>Candy corn looks like tiny traffic cones.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sure does.</p>
<p>At, like, a candy traffic school.</p>
<p>Like a little gingerbread man at the wheel, and he's drunk.</p>
<p>Look out.</p>
<p>We driving.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you keep wanting to eat yourself.</p>
<p>All day.</p>
<p>That's one of my biggest fears.</p>
<p>What is? If I ever, like, woke up as a doughnut.</p>
<p>You would eat yourself.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even question it.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>That would be tasty.</p>
<p>It's cool to know other people think about this stuff too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
