<p>Good morning, everybody.</p>
<p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
<p>I brought bagels.</p>
<p>Oh, I'd love a bagel.</p>
<p>The perfect beginning for my first day of billiards class.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Did you pick a special outfit so you could look sexy shooting pool? Shirley, I have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thirteen.</p>
<p>Oh, great, so much for "baggles."</p>
<p>So much for what? The "baggles." </p>
<p>You dropped them on the floor.</p>
<p>Uh, they're called "bay-gels." </p>
<p>Uh, I lived in New York, Troy.</p>
<p>I know what a "baggle" is.</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with you? What? You say "bagel" wrong.</p>
<p>I say it the same as you.</p>
<p>Say it again.</p>
<p>"Baggle." </p>
<p>Can we just keep studying? We're on page 258.</p>
<p>What "padge" was that? Two-five-tee-eight.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a drawing of Abed with hearts all around it.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Troy, the Bible condemns this level of friendship.</p>
<p>I didn't draw that.</p>
<p>I bought that used.</p>
<p>Must have been whoever had it last.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's a girl who has a crush on Abed.</p>
<p>This is so romantic.</p>
<p>It's just like The Notebook, except instead of Alzheimer's, Abed has --</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Someone who likes him.</p>
<p>Well, whoever she is, she's fat.</p>
<p>These thick pencil lines were drawn with a heavy hand.</p>
<p>We gotta find this person for Abed.</p>
<p>Unless it's a boy, then we find him for Jesus.</p>
<p>But either way, this is going to be fun.</p>
<p>Cute little face.</p>
<p>THEN CLASS REPEATING.]</p>
<p>THEN CLASS REPEATING.]</p>
<p>Guys, class is over.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get you to leave.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Pick that up.</p>
<p>Señor Chang? We're trying to figure out whose Spanish book this was before Troy's.</p>
<p>Jenny Adams.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>If all Chinese were psychic you would have started using birth control centuries ago.</p>
<p>Her name's in the front of the book, morons.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>He's right.</p>
<p>Them I understand.</p>
<p>But how did you not think of that? I may have been thrown off by Britta's pronunciation of the word "bagel." </p>
<p>How do you pronounce bagel? I don't.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>"Baggle." </p>
<p>You're the worst.</p>
<p>So we have a name.</p>
<p>Jenny Adams.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>See, it's a fat girl's name.</p>
<p>Might as well be Gravy Jones.</p>
<p>Pierce, it doesn't matter what she looks like.</p>
<p>This will be great for Abed.</p>
<p>It will? Aren't you excited about talking to her? I wasn't planning on it.</p>
<p>What? Guys, come on, you heard Abed.</p>
<p>He's not interested.</p>
<p>Drop it.</p>
<p>Jeff, you need to mind your own business.</p>
<p>Abed, you need to get with this girl, immediately, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Yeah? Abed, for guys like you, this kind of opportunity only comes around once in a life While.</p>
<p>It's important to date in college, Abed.</p>
<p>It's a time of freedom and exploration.</p>
<p>A time when a simple pillow fight between two innocent girls could turn to a steamy night of unbridled lust.</p>
<p>Britta knows all about it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So you guys are gonna <span class="reference">Can't Buy Me Love</span> me, right? We're gonna what you? You're gonna <span class="reference">Can't Buy Me Love</span> me.</p>
<p>You know, transform me from zero to hero, geek to chic.</p>
<p>Oh, he wants us to Love Don't Cost a Thing him.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Can't Buy Me Love was the remake for white audiences.</p>
<p>That's so uncomfortable when they do that.</p>
<p>I can't believe it doesn't insult them.</p>
<p>All right, nobody here is <span class="reference">Can't Buy Me Love</span>-ing or Love Don't Cost a Thing-ing anyone.</p>
<p>Because we've all seen enough after-school specials and Fat Albert to know -- Oh.</p>
<p>That Abed only needs to be himself.</p>
<p>Sure glad there are no old people here.</p>
<p>This conversation would probably be total gibberish to them.</p>
<p>Jeff's unprecedentedly right about this.</p>
<p>Abed, when we find this girl, you're gonna approach her just the way you are.</p>
<p>Because that's good enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then you can take her to a nice deli and treat her to a "baggle." </p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, nice shooting.</p>
<p>Good clean strokes.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Form a line, please.</p>
<p>My name is Coach Bogner.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Art of Pool, which is a phys ed class.</p>
<p>Which means that you all have to wear the proper equipment at all times.</p>
<p>So suit up.</p>
<p>See you back on the felt in 5.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>You're gonna look like an ass in those.</p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard.</p>
<p>I talked to your son on Family Day.</p>
<p>I know all about your gambling.</p>
<p>Touché.</p>
<p>All right, everybody just hang out and be casual.</p>
<p>My sources tell me that Jenny Adams is the blonde who's reading right over there.</p>
<p>Whoa! That's her? She's pretty.</p>
<p>Which is not a surprise at all, Abed.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed, we're gonna be here for moral support.</p>
<p>Just go over there, do your thing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Remember, be yourself.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah? What are you doing? I'm being myself.</p>
<p>Go be yourself by Jenny.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't go over there.</p>
<p>How do you know that? A lifetime of observation mostly.</p>
<p>Well, do you think there's a version of yourself that might go over there? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Could you be him? Okay.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What the hell was that? A different version of me.</p>
<p>I think he was a vampire.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If this is gonna turn ugly, I can't be here.</p>
<p>I'm a two-striker.</p>
<p>No, Pierce, please, hang on.</p>
<p>Abed, will you excuse us, please? Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I know that we're all good people.</p>
<p>And good people believe that people should be themselves.</p>
<p>But if Abed is himself, he's gonna die alone.</p>
<p>And if we let him be someone else Be right back.</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, there's a midget on stilts.</p>
<p>You're not in uniform.</p>
<p>Yeah, about that.</p>
<p>We seriously have to wear shorts to play pool? If you play in this class.</p>
<p>It's regulation.</p>
<p>Regulation pool or regulation you? Do you have something against playing pool with a full range of motion and optimal comfort? I'm comfortable in my own clothes.</p>
<p>I bet you are.</p>
<p>I'm sorry? I said I bet you're comfortable dressed like a model instead of an athlete, sipping martinis, smoking, instead of keeping your game on the table.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, man, you're implying I'm some sort of pool poser because I don't wanna wear a bathing suit.</p>
<p>You're the weird one.</p>
<p>That's weird, not me.</p>
<p>Nobody plays pool like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you call this? I call that your personal business, okay? And I call this class the desecration of America's coolest sport.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I -- See, right there.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>"Coolest sport." </p>
<p>Okay, I want everybody to know what's going on here.</p>
<p>This hipster is dropping this class because he cares more about what he looks like than how he's playing.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>You're the one with the rules about clothes.</p>
<p>And, by the way, I could kick your ass all over that table.</p>
<p>Oh, is that a challenge? Huh? Because if you play me in pool, you play me in shorts.</p>
<p>And if you can't do that, well, my point's already made.</p>
<p>I don't have anything to prove to you or Look, you're stupid.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>Pool in shorts is stupid.</p>
<p>Vanity, thy name is his name.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>It's the first day.</p>
<p>I didn't catch it.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed, we know that, normally, you wouldn't approach a girl.</p>
<p>But if you don't learn how, you won't get Jenny.</p>
<p>Yeah and you got two days.</p>
<p>Then I'm going after her.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>What, I'm incentivizing him.</p>
<p>Also, if she's into Abed, let's face it, anybody could hit that.</p>
<p>I understand, I need to change who I am to someone more likeable.</p>
<p>No, no, sweetie, it's not about changing.</p>
<p>It's about learning.</p>
<p>Learning to change? No, it's Good grief, clear the chickens off the runway.</p>
<p>I'll be the bad guy.</p>
<p>Yes, Abed, you need to be someone else.</p>
<p>Someone who, eventually, gets a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Because I can't think of anything more frightening than a half-Polish, half-Arab virgin in his 30s.</p>
<p>One way or the other, that story ends with an explosion.</p>
<p>Let's try a practice run.</p>
<p>All right, Annie, you sit here, okay, and be a girl.</p>
<p>Abed, you take a run at her.</p>
<p>Let's see what you got.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>What are you reading? Pride and Prejudice.</p>
<p>So you're familiar with two sins.</p>
<p>How about a third? Oh.</p>
<p>I don't think we're allowed to smoke in here.</p>
<p>Then you picked the wrong outfit, didn't you? Abed, what are you doing? Don Draper from <span class="reference">Mad Men</span>.</p>
<p>What'd you think? Awesome.</p>
<p>Put your tongue in her ear.</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p>Don't be him.</p>
<p>He cheats on his wife.</p>
<p>Be somebody nice like Mike Brady.</p>
<p>He always had that housekeeper throwing herself at him.</p>
<p>He never made a move on her.</p>
<p>Don't be Mike Brady.</p>
<p>Mike Brady's not sexy.</p>
<p>You should be like Jo from Facts of Life.</p>
<p>But you know, the dude version.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>You should be like Calvin.</p>
<p>His best friend was a tiger, he always went on dope adventures.</p>
<p>Anything stood in his way, he just peed on it.</p>
<p>Calvin Coolidge? No, you guys.</p>
<p>Don Draper was clearly the sexiest And the worst thing about it, is like that Calvin.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing? They're teaching me to be someone else.</p>
<p>Oh, for God's sake.</p>
<p>What did I tell you guys? Oh, for God's sakes, everybody, do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Leave each other alone.</p>
<p>Whoa, that's a good Jeff.</p>
<p>How'd you do that? Ten percent <span class="reference">Dick Van Dyke</span>, 20 percent Sam Malone, 40 percent Zach Braff in <span class="reference">Scrubs</span>, and 30 percent <span class="reference">Hilary Swank</span> in <span class="reference">Boys</span> Don't Cry.</p>
<p>Zach Braff? Sorry.</p>
<p>Abed, what if you just did Jeff for Jenny? Uh, and your point is? Look, I don't want any part of this.</p>
<p>And I can't believe tha --</p>
<p>That you're still doing it after I already explained the obvious lesson smacking you in the face.</p>
<p>Hey, why aren't you in billiards class? Because I don't look cool in shorts.</p>
<p>Oh! Whoa! Okay.</p>
<p>Because I'm not cool in shorts.</p>
<p>Now that's good.</p>
<p>That was really good.</p>
<p>I don't wanna spoil the ending but, uh, pride ends up with prejudice.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Stick with me, and you get a laugh or two.</p>
<p>That's the Abed guarantee.</p>
<p>I feel like I've seen you before.</p>
<p>It's working.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I get that a lot from art students.</p>
<p>I'm told I have a face made for sketching.</p>
<p>I'd rather think it was made for kissing.</p>
<p>How about for punching, huh? What are you doing hitting on my girlfriend, ugly? This is awkward.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It's a white Abed.</p>
<p>I, I know.</p>
<p>It, it's like Abed but employable.</p>
<p>Huh, boss? Let's go, Slumdog.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And one last Lost and Found announcement.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger, I've been informed by Coach Bogner that you left your panties in his pool class so better pick those up.</p>
<p>When is he gonna stop doing that? Do you know that he called me a hipster? Hipster.</p>
<p>Do hipsters walk around wearing $300 jeans from Italy? Can we please talk about Abed? Thanks to us, his heart's been broken.</p>
<p>Well, I hate to say that I told you so, so I'll shout it through cupped hands.</p>
<p>I told you so.</p>
<p>We were only trying to help.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, who are we kidding? Jeff's right.</p>
<p>Abed was happy being Abed till we had to sully his mind with thoughts of love and romance and vaginas.</p>
<p>Those are the big three.</p>
<p>That's what they call them.</p>
<p>Poor Abed.</p>
<p>He was probably too sad to get out of bed this morning.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>About yesterday --</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You guys must be pretty upset.</p>
<p>Why would we be upset? Well, I know how important it was for you that I get a girlfriend.</p>
<p>So when Jenny went off with white Abed, it must have really hurt.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>White Abed? Jenny's boyfriend is a white guy that's almost identical to Abed.</p>
<p>Name is Joey and that's why the sketch was in Troy's book.</p>
<p>So does that make Abed brown Joey? If you wanna get racist about it.</p>
<p>Abed, you know we just want you to be happy, right? Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Everybody wants me to be happy.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to help me.</p>
<p>But usually when they find out they can't, they get frustrated and stop talking to me.</p>
<p>Or they trick me into buying them ice cream and then shove me into a clothes dryer.</p>
<p>Which I didn't wanna happen with you guys so I wanted to make sure you felt you could help.</p>
<p>The truth is, lots of girls like me because, let's face it, I'm pretty adorable.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>And, uh, my aloofness unconsciously reminds them of their fathers, so I'm more used to them approaching me.</p>
<p>So we didn't damage your self-esteem or anything? Britta, I got self-esteem falling out of my butt.</p>
<p>That's why I was willing to change for you, because when you really know who you are and what you like about yourself changing for other people isn't such a big deal.</p>
<p>Abed, you're a god.</p>
<p>If you'll all excuse me, I have a man to beat in pool while wearing shorts.</p>
<p>Is that code for going number one or number two? Abed, you've inspired me too.</p>
<p>People can mock me all they want.</p>
<p>I don't care how I say the word "baggle." </p>
<p>"Baggle." </p>
<p>She said the word "baggle." </p>
<p>Okay, let's play some pool.</p>
<p>Hey, nice cross corner, Leonard.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>I'd like to see Jeff Winger try that shot without the benefit of his stylish clothing.</p>
<p>Oh, would you? Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be at a Urban Outfitters? I'll go there later if I feel like it.</p>
<p>But first I have to hand someone their tightly polyester-swaddled ass in a game of pool.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Oh, burn.</p>
<p>Now, do you wanna talk about clothes like a girl? Or use tapered sticks to hit balls around a cushioned table like a man? Balls, like a man.</p>
<p>Oh! Rack them.</p>
<p>I'll break.</p>
<p>Why? Because it looks cool? I don't know.</p>
<p>You tell me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Get out of the way.</p>
<p>Shh-shh, boom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me just clean this side of the table off here, all right? Oh, okay.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>See that? There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think of that? See, you haven't learned anything.</p>
<p>Except how to look cool playing pool in shorts.</p>
<p>You're wrong, man.</p>
<p>I'm just having a good time because I love playing pool.</p>
<p>Liar.</p>
<p>You think you look cool.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, how cool is this? Stop projecting your obsession with clothes onto me as an excuse for when I beat you in a game of real pool.</p>
<p>Oh, you wanna play real pool, huh? Oh! I'll play real pool.</p>
<p>Now who doesn't care how they look? Me.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be stopping this? Soon.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>Just gathering evidence.</p>
<p>Three-to-one against Winger.</p>
<p>Who's on? Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what, Jeff? One of us is about to win this game.</p>
<p>But years from now, when the story is retold, all they're gonna remember is one of us loved clothes and the other loved the game.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh ooh.</p>
<p>Oh! Ooh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.</p>
<p>You look at me.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>You beat me.</p>
<p>From now on, you play pool dressed however you choose.</p>
<p>I choose shorts.</p>
<p>I choose shorts.</p>
<p>Shorts.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>You magnificent son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Let me get in here.</p>
<p>Oh! Okay, you're sweaty.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Nice game.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Look, I, I hope this doesn't sound too forward.</p>
<p>But, um, could you introduce me to your friend? You know what? I, I know that guy's M.O., and I think it's better if you introduce yourself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Courtney.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Man, why couldn't I be Brown Joey? Tsk.</p>
<p>Hey, Abed.</p>
<p>Hey Troy.</p>
<p>Here's the book I borrowed.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Did you finally get your own book? Something like that.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Let's have cookies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>My cousin's funeral was today.</p>
<p>Oh, was that That was today? I knew there was some reason I couldn't do this today.</p>
<p>Poor Dmitri.</p>
