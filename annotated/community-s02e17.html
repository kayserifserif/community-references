<p>So I go into the bathroom with Tom, and we both, you know, take them out.</p>
<p>And I say, "Size more? Try size less." </p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I wanna go to rehab and compare penises with people.</p>
<p>All in good time, kiddo.</p>
<p>Well, uh, Pierce, we're very glad to have you back.</p>
<p>I'm assuming.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, what should we do now? I don't wanna be that guy, but I guess we should start studying anthropology.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, chapter four.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What is it, dean? Oh, ha-ha, I have exciting news.</p>
<p>Vice president Joe Biden has been visiting community colleges across the country as part of his Biden Time Talking About Teaching tour.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Folksy, yet progressive.</p>
<p>It does walk that line.</p>
<p>Anyway, his tour is taking him in this neck of the woods and at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Today, he is stopping by Greendale.</p>
<p>Eat that, city college and wash it down with a nice tall glass of suck it.</p>
<p>The vice president is coming.</p>
<p>That explains the people covertly surveilling the campus.</p>
<p>Must be Secret Service.</p>
<p>Will your reality ever come out on Blu-ray so we can enjoy it? We've been made.</p>
<p>Only problem, Mr. Biden is supposed to be meeting with the dean, hmm, and the head of our student government which doesn't exist.</p>
<p>So we have seven hours to elect a student president.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>What am I gonna wear? I mean, I could borrow my sister's Uncle Sam outfit.</p>
<p>It's tailored for ladies, but what else can I do on such short notice? Well, you cannot dress up like Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Or admit you don't have a sister.</p>
<p>We're electing a student president.</p>
<p>I wanna run.</p>
<p>I have so many ideas for improving the school.</p>
<p>Improving Greendale takes more than ideas, Annie.</p>
<p>It takes time, gasoline, matches.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Jeff, some of us care about more than just fixing our hair and sculpting our abs.</p>
<p>Wow, you got me pegged.</p>
<p>Democracy.</p>
<p>What a ruse.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as a system in which the masses Everyone wants you to shut up.</p>
<p>And yet I won't.</p>
<p>Case in point.</p>
<p>We tend to take democracy for granted in America.</p>
<p>We tend to take democracy for granted in America.</p>
<p>But the fact is, men have fought and died for the sacred right we exercise today.</p>
<p>So anyone who wants to be president, line up by the ice cream machine.</p>
<p>Your applause will determine who gets into the primaries.</p>
<p>And yes, this is a ladies' Uncle Sam outfit.</p>
<p>It's my sister's.</p>
<p>It was last minute.</p>
<p>I had no choice.</p>
<p>I wonder if that's the same sister that tweets me to ask if I think her brother's cute.</p>
<p>What happened to that pile of campaign fliers? I hung them all up.</p>
<p>Real nice.</p>
<p>Is it too much to ask you to pitch in? I'm sorry, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm not the worker bee type.</p>
<p>I'm more of a silverback gorilla with the claws of a lion, the teeth of a shark, and quiet dignity of a tortoise.</p>
<p>All right, first up is this fella.</p>
<p>Let's go, come on.</p>
<p>All right, tell everybody your name.</p>
<p>Garrett.</p>
<p>Okay, Garrett.</p>
<p>And why do you wanna be president? I wanted ice cream, so I got in line Okay, okay.</p>
<p>He wanted ice cream.</p>
<p>So, what do we say, gang? Does he make it to the next round? By applause.</p>
<p>Oh, we've got our first nominee.</p>
<p>The bar has been set.</p>
<p>All right, stand to the side.</p>
<p>Stand to the side.</p>
<p>At least worker bees can set aside their egos and join together to support a larger cause.</p>
<p>Oh, right, because politics are all about larger causes.</p>
<p>Face it, Annie.</p>
<p>Politics are all about ego, popularity, and parlor tricks.</p>
<p>Don't kid a lawyer.</p>
<p>Well, if I see one, I won't.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a girl.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>She's got a yellow shirt and a hat.</p>
<p>Who are you, sweetie? Uh, Vicki.</p>
<p>Who's up for some Vicki? Abed Nadir, I'm Special Agent Robin Vohlers.</p>
<p>This is Special Agent Keenlan of the Secret Service.</p>
<p>Will you submit to a search of your belongings? Sure.</p>
<p>How did you notice the campus was being observed? I guess I noticed because I'm used to being the only observer.</p>
<p>Well, we're not used to being noticed.</p>
<p>That sounds a little sad.</p>
<p>He's clean.</p>
<p>Although I could issue a warning for this bootleg of The Last Airbender.</p>
<p>Where were you a week ago? You can keep it.</p>
<p>Well, another one makes the cut.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Leonard.</p>
<p>Pbbt!</p>
<p>Oh, yes, wonderful.</p>
<p>Next up, Annie Edison.</p>
<p>My name is Annie Edison.</p>
<p>And if elected, I promise to make Greendale the signature community college of the entire western three quarters of the Greendale area.</p>
<p>Annie! Oh! Looks like you're in the running, Annie.</p>
<p>Looks like it is hard not to be.</p>
<p>Next up.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I got the heat, I gotta go.</p>
<p>I believe that humankind need not be governed.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Well, it's good to know there's a floor on this thing.</p>
<p>So, thank you, Ms. Perry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, Annie, I'm so proud of you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>People love you.</p>
<p>I believe this campus is a good place, filled with good people who just need someone to protect their interests.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>My name is Jeff.</p>
<p>I'm no politician.</p>
<p>I'm just a fella.</p>
<p>I think that beer should be cold and boots should be dusty.</p>
<p>I think 9l11 was bad.</p>
<p>And freedom, well, I think that's just a little bit better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoo! Yeah.</p>
<p>Countdown has begun.</p>
<p>Tonight, one student will be president, while the rest will simply be.</p>
<p>For Greendale Campus TV, I'm Abed Nadir.</p>
<p>I'm Troy "Butt Soup" Barnes.</p>
<p>That's my name.</p>
<p>As we head into the first round, there are eight candidates.</p>
<p>Annie Edison.</p>
<p>Smart, attractive, but easily vexed.</p>
<p> Leonard Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Did he change his last name?</p>
<p>He's trying to court the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p> Alex "Star-Burns" Osbourne.</p>
<p>Creepy, seems Greek , possible drug dealer.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Crowd favorite.</p>
<p>They call him Hot Wings.</p>
<p>Magnitude.</p>
<p>He's a one-man party.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>The wizard of wet wipes.</p>
<p>I live with that dude.</p>
<p> He's got night terrors.</p>
<p>Garrett.</p>
<p>That guy's just a mess.</p>
<p>It's like God spilled a person.</p>
<p>And Vicki.</p>
<p>Yellow shirt, hat, girl.</p>
<p>You know, you gotta ask yourself right now, Abed, what's up with politics? Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You're right, Troy.</p>
<p>I hear they're getting ready to start.</p>
<p>We'll turn it over to coverage of the debates.</p>
<p>Who's that? Special Agent Vohlers.</p>
<p>United States Secret Service.</p>
<p>Do you just constantly have your own side adventures? Yep.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Knock it off.</p>
<p>You're not running sincerely.</p>
<p>You're not even interested in student government.</p>
<p>I know, and yet, the people love me.</p>
<p>It's almost as if politics were a huge joke.</p>
<p>Okay, look.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I asked you to hang my fliers, but I suggest you drop out right now, because not only will I beat you, I will make you cry.</p>
<p>Oh, I feel a slight ego blowing in from the east.</p>
<p>You're gonna feel my foot blowing in from the south.</p>
<p>Bring it on, Ponce de Leon.</p>
<p>I'm gonna, Greg Muldunna.</p>
<p>It's a real guy.</p>
<p>He owns a mattress store downtown.</p>
<p>You can look it up.</p>
<p>Hey, Vicki.</p>
<p>Psst.</p>
<p>Vicki, look at me.</p>
<p>Psst.</p>
<p>I'm going to crush you.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Stop that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna eat your brains, Vicki.</p>
<p>I'm gonna slurp them out of that melon you call a head.</p>
<p>A reminder to all candidates, your microphones are currently on.</p>
<p>Well, they better be, because I'm on fire up here.</p>
<p>You freak people out, you know that? You look weird.</p>
<p>Because of your overbite.</p>
<p>Okay, let's just get started.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Greendale Community College presidential debate.</p>
<p>Candidates, if elected, what will you do? Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm running on a platform of school improvement.</p>
<p>If I'm elected, the black mold will be removed from the east stairwell.</p>
<p>The assailant known only as The Ass Crack Bandit will be brought to justice.</p>
<p>And I will balance the school's budget by eliminating administrative redundancies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm in the room.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ms. Edison.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger? Well, that's an important question.</p>
<p>And it's important to students like Jeremy, who told me that he is majoring in astronomy and is supporting two children.</p>
<p>It's an important question to Maria, who's a beautiful Latina born in Nicaragua - working in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What will I do, dean? Well, these people don't want me to say what I'll do.</p>
<p>They want me to do what I'll say.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>They love it when you shuffle the words around.</p>
<p>Go, Jeff.</p>
<p>Magnitude? Pop, pop.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Same question.</p>
<p>Same answer.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Mind if I ask you a few questions? Okay.</p>
<p>Was there a specific reason you had to repeat the first grade? I didn't know how to use scissors.</p>
<p>I sat in the middle of the seesaw.</p>
<p>I found the distinction between duck and goose arbitrary.</p>
<p>Couldn't you just pick the sixth kid every time? That's what I Would have done.</p>
<p>I went with four.</p>
<p>Jeez, get a room, you two.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne, your platform? My platform will be one high enough to push Vicki off to her death.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Vicki? It looks like Vicki is out of the race.</p>
<p>Well, then I am too.</p>
<p>I was only here to get back at her for not lending me a pencil.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Well, can we get back on track here? I just wanna get the black mold out of the east stairwell.</p>
<p>I just want to clean up Greendale.</p>
<p>Are you saying Greendale is dirty? Oh, boo.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>Well, of course it's dirty.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>I don't, Annie.</p>
<p>I think it's clean.</p>
<p>I think it's the cleanest school in the entire country.</p>
<p>You know it is.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger's got this thing in the bag.</p>
<p>Sure does.</p>
<p>Say what you will , but people just like the guy.</p>
<p>Read my lips.</p>
<p>No matter what you're told, we have to clean the mold.</p>
<p>No matter what you're told, we have to clean the mold.</p>
<p>That's right, people.</p>
<p>No matter what you're told, we have to clean the mold.</p>
<p>No matter what you're This is interesting, Annie Edison has reduced her platform to one issue and turned that issue into a sound bite.</p>
<p>And it rhymes.</p>
<p>People love it.</p>
<p>This election's become a race.</p>
<p>According to our polls, the campus is almost evenly divided.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the margin of error is about 98 percent.</p>
<p>Could be higher.</p>
<p>We don't even know how to do margins of error.</p>
<p>We're taking a break.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
<p>They have to.</p>
<p>It's closed-circuit television.</p>
<p>Don't know what that means.</p>
<p>And we're out.</p>
<p>Can I get an apple juice, please? Freshly squeezed, or so help me God, Maurice.</p>
<p>Abed, those guys in the suits are trashing your dorm room real bad, bro.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Random spot check.</p>
<p>Stay out of our way.</p>
<p>Nothing suspicious.</p>
<p>Glenn, bring the car around.</p>
<p>What are you looking for? Fertilizer, car battery, PVC piping.</p>
<p>Anything suspicious.</p>
<p>Because you think I'm suspicious? Or you wish I was suspicious so that you would have an excuse to see me.</p>
<p>This was a spot check.</p>
<p>Do you like me? That's not really relevant.</p>
<p>That's close enough.</p>
<p>Are you sure? You smell like nice soap.</p>
<p>I have to go.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you weren't a more obvious potential threat to the country.</p>
<p>People are pretty excited about this black mold issue.</p>
<p>For my closing statement, I'm thinking about smashing a watermelon.</p>
<p>Jeff, if I admit politics are stupid, will you stop making them stupid? You're gonna split the vote and Star-Burns is gonna end up president.</p>
<p>I'm the only one who's trying to get something done.</p>
<p>And you deserve to be allowed to do it? You're entitled to be president? The gloves are coming off.</p>
<p>You understand me? I have an audio-visual presentation.</p>
<p>Wow, I'm shaking.</p>
<p>You should be.</p>
<p>You should be.</p>
<p>All right, let us resume.</p>
<p>Star-Burns, we haven't heard from you on this black mold issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually withdraw my candidacy.</p>
<p>I fear a political career will shine a negative light on my drug dealing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>Dean, before this election stops being about the issues, I have a question for my opponents.</p>
<p>What's your favorite color? Mine's a three-way tie.</p>
<p>Red, white and blue.</p>
<p>Magnitude, a response? I think you know, dean.</p>
<p>Pop, pop.</p>
<p>I set him up.</p>
<p>I have an audio-visual presentation, dean.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds interesting.</p>
<p>What's your presentation? My presentation is a copy of Jeff Winger's for MTV's The Real World.</p>
<p>What? What? Let's just roll it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm Jeff Winger and I'd l<span class="reference titles">The Real World</span>TV's Real World: Seattle.</p>
<p>So check this out.</p>
<p># Well, I guess it would be nice #</p>
<p># If I could be on MTV #</p>
<p># So please, please take a look at me #</p>
<p># For The Real World #</p>
<p># Oh, I'm gonna apply twice #</p>
<p>Where did you get that? Folks, who do y<span class="reference titles">The Real World</span>g Joe Biden's hand at 5 p.m? Me or--? Shut up.</p>
<p>I was like 19.</p>
<p>We've all been 19, Jeff, and none of us did this.</p>
<p>None of us.</p>
<p>Pop, pop.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>I hate this school.</p>
<p>And I hope you all get black mold poisoning.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeffrey, no.</p>
<p>I hate you! I hate you! No, Jeffrey, no.</p>
<p># You gotta have Jeff, Jeff, Jeff #</p>
<p>Are you in here? Yeah, to be alone.</p>
<p>I've already established the men's room doesn't work.</p>
<p>You have an apartment.</p>
<p>There are people in the parking lot singing that song.</p>
<p>I went too far.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I didn't know it would be that bad.</p>
<p>You knew.</p>
<p>You didn't care.</p>
<p>But don't apologize.</p>
<p>I got what I deserved.</p>
<p>I am a gross, jaded adult with control issues that couldn't let a young, bright, idealistic kid run for president.</p>
<p>Wait, isn't there a final round of debates? Yeah.</p>
<p>I -- You guys.</p>
<p>You're missing it.</p>
<p>Troy, I'm out.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I withdrew my candidacy.</p>
<p>Nobody that treats a friend the way I did is fit to represent the student body.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know you're both out.</p>
<p>I'm saying you're missing it.</p>
<p>It's the political showdown of the century.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pbbt! Pop.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pbbt! Pbbt!</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>You should have stayed in the running.</p>
<p>You're the only real candidate.</p>
<p>No, I was just another jerk trying to win a contest.</p>
<p>You were right the whole time.</p>
<p>I just couldn't admit it until I saw you running away crying.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>I care what you think about me, you know? Yeah, well, I care what you think about me.</p>
<p>That's why this happened.</p>
<p>Okay, well, resolved, then.</p>
<p>Resolved.</p>
<p>When we seek to destroy others, we often hurt ourself, because it is the self that wants to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Pierce, you're not usually so poignant.</p>
<p>Well, Vicki finally lent me her pencil.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Pierce.</p>
<p>Go to the health center.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We've reached the end of election road.</p>
<p>Arguments have been made, pops have been popped.</p>
<p>Hearts have been stirred, perhaps broken.</p>
<p>The only thing that remains is to tally the vote in this matchup between the youthful, charismatic Magnitude and Leonard Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Two men fighting for the same piece of earth.</p>
<p>One recently born, one soon to die.</p>
<p>A competition reflecting the pointlessness of life.</p>
<p>Pull up, Abed.</p>
<p>You're in a nose dive.</p>
<p>I'm told that Dean Pelton is prepared to announce a winner.</p>
<p>We take you live to across the room.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sergio.</p>
<p>With 11 votes cast Eleven, come on, people.</p>
<p>The landslide winner of the student election with seven votes is South Park.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know what? I recall this is why we abolished student government in the first place.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Hey, how hard is it to get rid of black mold? What do we need, buckets and sponges? I don't actually know.</p>
<p>I'll look it up.</p>
<p>Milady.</p>
<p>Well, there you have it.</p>
<p>In a shocking write-in upset, Comedy Central series South Park has been elected president of the Greendale student body.</p>
<p>Not that shocking to me, I voted for it.</p>
<p>For real? Me too.</p>
<p>We can never stop being friends.</p>
<p>As we begin gearing up for next year's election, for GC TV, I'm Abed Nadir saying: Did you know you could make napalm out of dish soap and cat food? What? Why would you say that? Hmm? Vohlers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sir, we're gonna have to move on to city college.</p>
<p>There's an elevated threat level at Greendale.</p>
<p>But don't worry.</p>
<p>I'll check it out.</p>
<p>Personally.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I just had a dream that I was a regular president.</p>
<p>You've done so much for our city.</p>
<p>Kickpuncher, is there anything that we can give you? Don't call me Kickpuncher.</p>
<p>Call me David.</p>
<p>This was fun.</p>
<p>Maybe you can observe me having dinner next time.</p>
<p>Honk twice for yes, once for no.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
