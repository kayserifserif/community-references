<p>Troy and Abed back from summer Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Something's changed.</p>
<p>There's 12 additional thumbtacks on that board.</p>
<p>They're driving me crazy.</p>
<p>No, I meant this.</p>
<p>Trying out the hipster look.</p>
<p>It's cool, but also not.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, have a good summer? Take them off.</p>
<p>Happy first day of school.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>I brought brownies.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Congratulations, it's me.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>I see we've all reinvented ourselves over the summer.</p>
<p>A little late to the hipster party much? A little much on the "much" much? We should get to class.</p>
<p>Where's Pierce? I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey-o.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm late.</p>
<p>Damn Mexican cleaning woman did a cha-cha on my glasses so I gotta wear this old pair.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah? Did you go to your happy place? Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you envision a babbling brook like I described? I started with a babbling brook, then layered in elements from our world.</p>
<p>I'm sure fans of the brook will complain, but it was limiting.</p>
<p>Keep it simple.</p>
<p>It was a babbling brook.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here's the deal, <span class="reference people">Jessica Biel</span>.</p>
<p>The first day of senior year is emotional for everyone so I hereby therapize you to go to your happy place whenever you feel stressed.</p>
<p>I found my lucky notebook.</p>
<p>Found my lucky charm.</p>
<p>Abed, you ready for our last first day of school? Are you ready, buddy? I just need a minute.</p>
<p># This is my show #</p>
<p># It's about me #</p>
<p># And all my friends on Abed TV #</p>
<p># My happy place #</p>
<p># Nothing but fun #</p>
<p># Nothing but laughs and smiles #</p>
<p># And then we rerun #</p>
<p># For those times #</p>
<p># When life's too hard to face #</p>
<p># I'll find some happy #</p>
<p># In my happy place #</p>
<p>Abed's Happy Community College Show is filmed before a live audience inside of my head.</p>
<p>I can't believe we're getting into this class.</p>
<p>I can't believe there's a History of Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Seniors.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>There they are.</p>
<p>I missed you guys.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Seniors.</p>
<p>Oh! Speaking of seniors, I've decided I'm gonna do senioritis this year.</p>
<p>You know, just hanging out and blowing off classes, pullin' pranks, not saying my G's.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I'll pull some pranks with you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or Jeff or whoever.</p>
<p>You know, whoever's around, whatever.</p>
<p>Abed, we're still doing our first-day-of-school tradition? You know it.</p>
<p>We make wishes in the fountain.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Fellas, I hate to tell you, wishes aren't real.</p>
<p>If you want something bad, you have to work for it.</p>
<p>Or use a spell.</p>
<p>All of our wishes come true.</p>
<p>Last year, Troy wished we got Bin Laden and the Dorito taco.</p>
<p>But Obama got credit for both.</p>
<p>Could you wish for Jeff to be on time? No.</p>
<p>No wasting wishes on impossibilities.</p>
<p>We have to make this year count, especially since it's the last one.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Is all this for The History of Ice Cream? Overbooked.</p>
<p>It's first come, first serve now.</p>
<p>Just like real ice cream.</p>
<p>Guys, over here.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff, I can't believe that you came early.</p>
<p>Don't you read Garrett's Twitter? He posted a crisis alert about it.</p>
<p>I came early to save seats.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what, girls? I gave you the old flyer.</p>
<p>Instagram for Besties is in Room 44.</p>
<p>Showing up early, helping others, sending girls away? Could this be a whole new Jeff Winger? Don't ruin it by approving it.</p>
<p>Oh, so that's progressed.</p>
<p>I mean, it's progressed, but it hasn't "progressed" progressed.</p>
<p>It's progressive.</p>
<p>Good luck, Troy.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>You can't just walk in here.</p>
<p>I've been pissing in jars for an hour trying to keep this seat.</p>
<p>Leonard, keep those-- Yes.</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p>Simmer dean.</p>
<p>This can't be good.</p>
<p>He's dressed as himself.</p>
<p>Greendale's registration system has been hacked.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Someone hacked into the supply closet and counterfeited these History of Ice Cream admission cards.</p>
<p>Whoever did this is very good.</p>
<p>There is only one fair way to solve this.</p>
<p>So follow me to The Hunger Deans.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>There are 35 tests of strength and agility.</p>
<p>The winner of each one of these contests will be awarded a red rubber ball.</p>
<p>No ball, no ice cream.</p>
<p>And these are impossible to counterfeit because each one has been marked by my distinct bite print.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We need to take this class.</p>
<p>It's the only history credit this semester.</p>
<p>Whatevs.</p>
<p>We'll take it next semes.</p>
<p>Ter.</p>
<p>Semester.</p>
<p>But I need it now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I took some extra classes online and I'm one history credit away from graduating.</p>
<p>Jeff, you're graduating early? Well, graduating after 30 can't be characterized as early.</p>
<p>When were you gonna tell us? I was working on a speech.</p>
<p>Believe me, it tied in a lot of things.</p>
<p>There was a lot of resolutions and epiphanies.</p>
<p>It would have gone down a lot better after we had taken the ice cream class together.</p>
<p>That's why you held our seats, your own selfish reasons.</p>
<p>No, I want us to take the class together.</p>
<p>I just want it to be the last class we take together.</p>
<p>I should've phrased that differently.</p>
<p>Win your ball.</p>
<p>What do I care? I've got a senior prank to pull.</p>
<p>Shirley.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Abed, ready to make some wishes? Make chocolate hot dogs a reality? Go with Britta.</p>
<p>I'll just hang out here and watch.</p>
<p>Really? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine.</p>
<p>F-I-N-E or F-Y-N-E? We made one of them a code for "not fine."</p>
<p>F-Y-N-E.</p>
<p>Okay, he's fine.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>See you around, old Jeff.</p>
<p>No, new Jeff.</p>
<p>New Jeff does not just look out for himself.</p>
<p>New Jeff is gonna win seven red balls.</p>
<p>Because he is not gonna take that class unless you guys are with me.</p>
<p>Look, we're gonna have to leave this place sometime.</p>
<p>Like an ice cream cone melting in the sun, our time here can't last forever.</p>
<p>That was part of the speech I was writing.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>What's going on? Just making plans for the future.</p>
<p>Can't stay at Greendale forever.</p>
<p>Hey, is mine different than yours? Look out below.</p>
<p>Coming in for a Ian-dean.</p>
<p>Amelia Earhart? Close.</p>
<p>I am America's sexiest aviator, Leo DiCaprio.</p>
<p>And just as his character lost his mind so have I lost your student records.</p>
<p>What? I can't believe it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Amelia Earhart would have been faster.</p>
<p>As you know, our student records are stored on a Microsoft Paint file, which I was assured was future-proof.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our extended warranty is not being honored by the restaurant that used to be Circuit City.</p>
<p>But I think the fairest way to handle this is to have everyone repeat the last three years.</p>
<p>You can't be serious.</p>
<p>In-dean, I am.</p>
<p>We're gonna be here forever.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>I'm gonna stay in here forever.</p>
<p>Gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<p>My first red ball is way up high.</p>
<p>To touch my ball, first touch the sky.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Give it up, Leonard.</p>
<p>I'm gonna eat your ice cream, Winger.</p>
<p>Ugh! You? You're premed.</p>
<p>I want ice cream.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I wanna graduate with dignity.</p>
<p>Come over.</p>
<p>Jeff's really going after that ball.</p>
<p>There's gotta be a joke in there somewhere.</p>
<p>That's my first ball.</p>
<p>New Jeff.</p>
<p>Give me a minute.</p>
<p>Give me a minute.</p>
<p>This one! This one! Whew.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If we're doing the first three years over again, I could change majors.</p>
<p>I've always been curious about forensics.</p>
<p>Did you know you could major in antics? You need a tomfoolery prereq.</p>
<p>They waive it for women.</p>
<p>This is lunacy.</p>
<p>We are not gonna start over as freshmen.</p>
<p>Hey, there's a freshman mixer tonight.</p>
<p>Are you guys freshmen? We can be.</p>
<p>This prank is amazing.</p>
<p>He's gonna come in here later and have the creepy feeling someone was in here.</p>
<p>We should go before we get caught.</p>
<p>Aren't we gonna do something? Do something? Mm-mm-mm.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>A prank on a prank.</p>
<p>Let's move everything on his desk over an inch except his stapler.</p>
<p>Then he'll think we moved his stapler.</p>
<p>There's so many levels to this.</p>
<p>How about we fill his car with popcorn? That sounds messy.</p>
<p>That sounds messy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Keys.</p>
<p>Keys- Okay, I'm the dean.</p>
<p>I come into my office, turn on the light.</p>
<p>"Oh, my, did my stapler grow legs and move?" Then come over here for coffee.</p>
<p>I would hide my keys in Huh.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Heels.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You got skills.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Look who got his ball.</p>
<p>Not my ball, your ball.</p>
<p>I wanted you guys to see it.</p>
<p>New Jeff.</p>
<p>Is that blood on your shirt? Oh, no, it's cool.</p>
<p>It's Leonard's.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Two balls.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>This is gonna be so good when I finally get it.</p>
<p>It's a little weird doing this without Abed.</p>
<p>Come on, it'll be fun.</p>
<p>I'll put my Britta twist on it.</p>
<p>I got skills.</p>
<p>I got skills.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Let's get this started.</p>
<p>We always do the first one together.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>A great school year.</p>
<p>A thousand wishes.</p>
<p>Great school year? First wish is always for 1000 wishes.</p>
<p>But we have all these coins.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the coins aren't the wishes.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn't know that.</p>
<p>I wish for Britta to have 499 of my remaining wishes.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I wish to end all wars.</p>
<p>That's another rule.</p>
<p>No wishes containing the word "all." </p>
<p>Guaranteed ironic consequences.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone's gonna miss wars.</p>
<p>Uh, Star Wars, thumb wars.</p>
<p>Wow, Storage Wars.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>You can't get in.</p>
<p>I'm taking that penny back.</p>
<p>The pennies aren't wishes.</p>
<p>You can't flip a wish.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Your rules are ridiculous.</p>
<p>They're Abed's rules.</p>
<p>They're awesome.</p>
<p>They always work.</p>
<p>Well, Abed's not here so unwish.</p>
<p>You can't do that.</p>
<p>I just did.</p>
<p>Unwish.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Rewish.</p>
<p>Unwish.</p>
<p>Un-unwish.</p>
<p>Give me! Unwish! No! Uhn! No! Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>What-- ? You're helping me! You're helping.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Unwish! Unwish! Why does this feel good? Stupid, selfish Jeff coming here ruining our senior year.</p>
<p>Uh! Great, my G's are back.</p>
<p>It's crummy Jeff is leaving early, but we're all graduating eventually.</p>
<p>But why the rush? What, so Jeff can run off and be a gross lawyer again? Troy and Abed start drinking coffee? I become a boring hospital administrator? Who wants to do that? You do.</p>
<p>Right? Yay.</p>
<p>Hospital administration.</p>
<p>Can't wait to be buried alive under a pile of paperwork and bedpans, trying to summon the courage to ask out Dr. Patel, the gorgeous neurosurgeon who doesn't know I exist.</p>
<p>This isn't a conversation, is it? Whoo-hoo.</p>
<p>The sad, slow march toward death begins.</p>
<p>Senioritis.</p>
<p>Ready, set Third ball.</p>
<p>Fourth ball.</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>Looks like someone wants to be a hero.</p>
<p>A big man.</p>
<p>A huge, throbbing, sweaty-- I wanna get my history credit and get out of here.</p>
<p>And I just need to know how bad you want it.</p>
<p>Next competition will be particularly difficult for some of you because it requires complete emotional commitment.</p>
<p>The tango.</p>
<p>I will be the judge.</p>
<p>There can only be one winner so choose your partners wisely.</p>
<p>Come on, Winger.</p>
<p>Water under the bridge, right? Partners? Sorry, my dance card's full.</p>
<p>For my partner in the tango competition, I choose the dean.</p>
<p>The fountain works.</p>
<p>All these balls.</p>
<p>I'm so close, I can taste it.</p>
<p>Pierce, only you could turn a freshman mixer into a disaster! I was this close to getting those two girls.</p>
<p>Look how close you're holding your fingers together.</p>
<p>That's your penis.</p>
<p>Guys, great news.</p>
<p>After just one forensics class, I found a way to retrieve our student records.</p>
<p>It turns out there's a backup, and it's in this safe.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I have a theory, dean.</p>
<p>Do tell.</p>
<p>I don't think you want me to graduate.</p>
<p>Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>I want success for all Greendale students.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Then answer me this.</p>
<p>What happened to the other history class? What other history class? The second history class, the one that actually taught history that disappeared from the schedule after I took summer classes.</p>
<p>You're telling yourself a fantasy.</p>
<p>Who really made those counterfeited ice cream tickets? Who's so good that they got your handwriting with its hearts and flourishes? Oh, God, you're right.</p>
<p>I can't let you go, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You weren't supposed to compete.</p>
<p>You were supposed to walk away with the group.</p>
<p>You can't not get rid of me that easily.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Why'd I make it feats of strength and grace? It's It's as if I wanted you to win.</p>
<p>But that can't be true.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Best friends.</p>
<p>So let's hug it out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>One more ball to go.</p>
<p>But it's another dance contest, so I think I got it.</p>
<p>What's wrong with Abed? Don't.</p>
<p>We're redoing our first three years.</p>
<p>That's what I want.</p>
<p>It's okay, Abed.</p>
<p>Here's a trick I use when I feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Just imagine a happy place and then go there.</p>
<p>Greendale Babies They're happy and they're free Greendale Babies Fun for you and me Greendale Babies forever Greendale Babies will be right back.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Greendale Babies Pierce, what did you do to Abed? Gay balls.</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>Don't ask.</p>
<p>Don't tell.</p>
<p>Poor Abed.</p>
<p>Is he in his imagination emporium? Dreamatorium? No, this seems like something new.</p>
<p>Abed was having some anxiety about all the changes this year so I may have told him to go to a happy place in his mind.</p>
<p>You told him to go somewhere in his mind? Do you realize who you told that to? The last competition to win a red ball begins in one minute.</p>
<p>Honestly, Jeff, you can go.</p>
<p>No one will think you're selfish.</p>
<p>This looks bad.</p>
<p>I wish I hadn't broken Abed.</p>
<p>There is one thing we could try.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Hey, let's play pretend.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could be cowboys.</p>
<p>We could be spacemen.</p>
<p>That's right, baby Pierce.</p>
<p>We can play forever.</p>
<p>It's not working.</p>
<p>What's not working? Okay, contestants, final competition begins right now.</p>
<p>God, I hate new Jeff.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, I have something to say.</p>
<p>Yay! Like always.</p>
<p>I was just outside Babyville.</p>
<p>There's nothing outside Babyville.</p>
<p>You know what? There is.</p>
<p>And it was scary, because change is always scary.</p>
<p>But then I thought of you guys, and I wasn't so scared.</p>
<p>Abed, when you brought this group together, you changed our lives.</p>
<p>But then we changed each other.</p>
<p>And we're gonna keep changing in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>We'll still be friends even if we don't all become professors at Greendale, open a restaurant, or move into the same apartment building after Pierce dies.</p>
<p>And even if we go somewhere, we're not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Aww That was a killer speech, Jeff.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything.</p>
<p>I literally just walked up.</p>
<p>I made the speech for you.</p>
<p>It hit all the right notes.</p>
<p>I was trying to hang on to this moment because I was afraid of the future.</p>
<p>But then I realized all of this was once the future.</p>
<p>It was different from what I'd known before, and it was happening so fast.</p>
<p>But in the end, or in the now, I guess, it turned out great.</p>
<p>And just like ice cream, we've melted together and made a new-- I just had to run the scenario to figure it out.</p>
<p>Sorry I missed the fountain.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Britta introduced a new rule: No rules.</p>
<p>We can discuss it.</p>
<p>When they were incepting, I got their balls.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Over there.</p>
<p>Get out of the way.</p>
<p>Now that we're out of History of Ice Cream, I can finally take Advanced Claims Denial.</p>
<p>You should take forensics.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me what the hell we just did? Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, wait.</p>
<p>What are you-- ? Oh.</p>
<p>You smell like the floor of a movie theater.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not for the usual reasons.</p>
<p>I have had the worst day.</p>
<p>Our dance photo didn't come out, someone moved my stapler, and, worst of all, I hurt you.</p>
<p>You'll be happy to know that we'll be offering another history class because I care about you.</p>
<p>Not because I found out if we don't offer a real history class, we'll lose $40,000 in grant money.</p>
<p>Thank you, dean.</p>
<p>You didn't have to come all this way to tell me that.</p>
<p>Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.</p>
<p>It's on my way.</p>
<p>Tell me you're breaking into that condo.</p>
<p>No, I bought it.</p>
<p>Now we'll be like almost roomies.</p>
<p>Oh, good, you got wine.</p>
<p>I've got Friends With Benefits.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>No subtext.</p>
<p>I don't know why I was so worried about change.</p>
<p>This year's gonna be great.</p>
<p>I'll be right over.</p>
<p>"Hello. My name is Kevin. I have Changnesia."</p>
<p>Sure this will work? Guaranteed to.</p>
<p>It's an antic.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Not so fast, you two.</p>
<p>Get ready to run.</p>
<p>In these heels? Where'd you girls get those dresses? They're fabulous.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>They're charming.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Not so fast, mister.</p>
<p>Excuse you? Excuse me.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Not for you.</p>
<p>Hello, it's Britta.</p>
<p>Okay, I know a man when I see one.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, no.</p>
<p></p>
