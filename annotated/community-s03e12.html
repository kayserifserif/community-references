<p>Hi, Pierce.</p>
<p>Oh - Hi! Hi, Percival! - Hi.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, you guys.</p>
<p>Do anything fun over break? Oh, baby Ben got to be baby Jesus in our church's nativity play.</p>
<p>Andre was Joseph, and Jordan was one of the wise men, and I was in charge of casting.</p>
<p>I digitized my entire movie collection.</p>
<p>Goodbye, VHS.</p>
<p>Hello, SelectaVision CED Videodisc.</p>
<p>I'm very psyched for the new semester.</p>
<p>Or should I say Intro to Human Psyched.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>For our midterm, we actually get to diagnose a fellow student with something.</p>
<p>Don't you do way too much of that already? Accusational opposition disorder.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>It appears you've all noticed that my swagger has a new swagger.</p>
<p>I'll explain.</p>
<p>Over break, I took the plunge and started seeing a new shrink.</p>
<p>What? Hello! Hello.</p>
<p>Anyway, I talked about my dad, punched a few pillows.</p>
<p>And she put me on this amazing anti-anxiety pill.</p>
<p>It's really enhanced my self-confidence.</p>
<p>I explained that really well.</p>
<p>Jeff, you can't be on anti-anxiety meds.</p>
<p>What little self-doubt you have is the only thing keeping your ego penned in.</p>
<p>You are a textbook narcissist.</p>
<p>I'm an exceptional narcissist, Britta.</p>
<p>Oh, excuse me.</p>
<p>I didn't kill my wife! I don't care.</p>
<p>Stop that fugitive! I was wondering how long it would take for things to get back to normal.</p>
<p>Over break, Abed realized he could hire celebrity impersonators from a service for his own personal use.</p>
<p>He's been doing it a lot.</p>
<p>He's not hurting anybody.</p>
<p>He just likes reenacting scenes from movies.</p>
<p>It's unquestionably awesome.</p>
<p>I question it.</p>
<p>He spent New Year's locked in our bathroom with a bad Tom <span class="reference">Tom Hanks</span>m cast away.</p>
<p>Abed was the volleyball? - Well, that makes sense.</p>
<p>You guys, focus! Where's he getting the money for all this? Intervention.</p>
<p>Intervention.</p>
<p>Intervention.</p>
<p>No! You guys need to stop intervening.</p>
<p>You seriously have a problem.</p>
<p>I said I didn't kill my wife! - I still don't care.</p>
<p>Freeze! Chang, they're just acting! - Oh.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>What was that? - Somebody call the cops! - I've got a friend at the zoo.</p>
<p>What is this I hear about a tranquilizer gun? If you had hit a small student, they could have died! I wouldn't do that.</p>
<p>I have a heavy flashlight for them.</p>
<p>Oh, Ben! Look, I have to resort to extreme measures.</p>
<p>I'm a one-man army.</p>
<p>You won't let me have any guards.</p>
<p>We're broke, Ben! We now get 80% of our electricity from the apartment building across the street.</p>
<p>Okay I don't know who told you pouting was an option for you, but all you're making me feel right now is hatred of Renee Zellweger.</p>
<p>Look, maybe you can bring on some students as security interns.</p>
<p>I'll let you offer them a credit in safety or math or something.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>You won't regret this unless I rise up against you.</p>
<p>I don't know why I said that.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Huh! Tah! Zhou! Zeet! Dah! Toi! Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff! I looked it up.</p>
<p>I was right.</p>
<p>Oh, that thing about Danny Thomas? I looked it up too.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>No, those meds you're taking.</p>
<p>Without anxiety to keep your vanity in check, you are vulnerable to a syndrome called hyper-narcissosis.</p>
<p>Okay, look.</p>
<p>This apple is your ego.</p>
<p>Imagine it expanding to the point of critical mass, taking over your whole personality, making you an uncontrollable monster.</p>
<p>Britta, how did an apple make that clear? Imagine it expanding? - Use a balloon.</p>
<p>I was on my way to lunch.</p>
<p>Why are you trying to take this away from me? I like having no anxiety.</p>
<p>I'm in harmony with the world.</p>
<p>Looking good, Winger.</p>
<p>Thank you, Leonard, for that compliment, and for your service to this country.</p>
<p>I'm so confident now, I can pull things off I never dreamed possible.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Aviators.</p>
<p>Final boarding call, beefcake airways.</p>
<p>I'm warning you as your friend to get off of those meds.</p>
<p>And until they're out of your system, stay away from flattering situations weddings, soft lighting, formal wear, gay bars.</p>
<p>And take those off! Because they make me look good? That's not relevant.</p>
<p>Ah, welcome back, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>How was your -- uh uhh unh! Oh, my God! Even his shadow! Look at his shadow! </p>
<p>Security internship available.</p>
<p>Come on, see the world.</p>
<p>Well, you won't see the world, but come on! - Hey, Nadir.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Vinnie.</p>
<p>Vinnie's the owner of the doppelgang, the celebrity impersonator service I use.</p>
<p>You look familiar.</p>
<p>That's how we all get started in this racket.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, if you're smart, you move up to management before the gold mine of resembling French Stewart runs dry.</p>
<p>Ah - French Stewart And speaking of gold mines, you owe me three grand, pal.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Put it on my account.</p>
<p>What do I look like, a sucker? French Stewart.</p>
<p>But I don't have three grand.</p>
<p>Well, you know what, you better get it.</p>
<p>Because I'm gonna tell you something right now Holy crap, you'd make an amazing Seacrest.</p>
<p>Very kind.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You're actually a lot taller than Seacrest.</p>
<p>You've actually got a sharper jaw too.</p>
<p>You're actually more handsome than the guy that's famous for being handsome.</p>
<p>Jeff? You'll be okay.</p>
<p>Just stay humble.</p>
<p>You know what, maybe there's another option for you.</p>
<p>I've got a big event saturday.</p>
<p>Needs a lot of bodies, huh? And I see some high-value faces here.</p>
<p>Got an Oprah.</p>
<p>Oh! - And sitting next to her is a Judy Garland or an Anne Hathaway.</p>
<p>Add a few extra teeth.</p>
<p>Wow, this is rare.</p>
<p>Both versions of Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>A<span class="reference">Michael Jackson</span>ando.</p>
<p>Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p>What?<span class="reference">Burt Reynolds</span>t Brando.</p>
<p>Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p>Whatever.<span class="reference">Burt Reynolds</span>ok, if you guys work this gig for me for six hours, we'll call it even.</p>
<p>Sounds fun.</p>
<p>Abed, Vinnie, can we have a minute to talk about this? Sure.</p>
<p>Come on, Vinnie.</p>
<p>The guy who makes the fish sticks looks just like Quincy Jones.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Serio<span class="reference">Quincy Jones</span>I'm sorry, but this is where we have to put our foot down.</p>
<p>Well, she has a point.</p>
<p>Next time it'll be $10,000, and then $20,000, and then he'll hit rock bottom and have no one to turn to but Jesus.</p>
<p>I say we let this play out.</p>
<p>I'd love to help, but playing Ryan Seacrest at a big party may not be a safe situation for me.</p>
<p>We could actually hurt Abed if every time he faces reality, we dress up and play make-believe to bail him out.</p>
<p>Shame on you people.</p>
<p>It's not our job to help Abed grow up.</p>
<p>Abed doesn't need reality.</p>
<p>Abed is a magical, elf-like man who makes us all more magical by being near us.</p>
<p>Pierce, who came over in the middle of the night that time you forgot how to fart? - Abed.</p>
<p>Shirley, who got you a DVD of Precious, based on the novel Push, by Sapphire, and a copy of t<span class="reference">Push</span>ovel <span class="reference">Sapphire</span>ographed by Sapphire? Abed<span class="reference">Push</span>l we had was dum<span class="reference">Sapphire</span>y before we met that man.</p>
<p>And he's made all of our lives better than reality.</p>
<p>Now it becomes a little inconvenient, and it's time to get real? For shame! He's right.</p>
<p>Sorry, Troy.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Abed, we would be happy to help you out.</p>
<p>It'll be a good time.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Oprah.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>See ya, Vin.</p>
<p>Fat Brando.</p>
<p>Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for being flexible.</p>
<p><span class="reference">Burt Reynolds</span>n.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>But here's the deal.</p>
<p>Um, if you guys mess this up, then his debt is overdue.</p>
<p>And I don't send another bill.</p>
<p>No, I send two guys that look a lot like Ving Rhames and Michael Chiklis.</p>
<p>And they do a very convincing imp<span class="reference">Michael Chiklis</span>king your friend's legs.</p>
<p>Their secret is They actually break them.</p>
<p>All right, impersonators, our guest of honor is one Howie Schwartz, who, according to the Talmud, just became a man.</p>
<p>But I have to say, I wouldn't want him next to me in a foxhole.</p>
<p>Ha! - Ground rules Do stay in your assigned quadrants quoting lines from movies you are positive that your impersonatee was in.</p>
<p>Do not leave your quadrant, burp, fart, cough, hiccup, or cuss.</p>
<p>The obvious exception being James, our resident Walter Matthau.</p>
<p>How you doing, Jimmy? Aw, you give '<span class="reference">Walter Matthau</span>ight, let's go.</p>
<p>All my life I has to fight.</p>
<p>Ready to tangle.</p>
<p>Handsome Seacrest, I need you in this tux.</p>
<p>Jeff, do not wear that.</p>
<p>Aw, zip it, white Jacko.</p>
<p>Don't worry, that thing in the cafeteria freaked me out, so I talked to my shrink, and she doubled my dosage.</p>
<p>What? Jeff, that's insane! I thought so too, but after I took that extra pill, it seemed like a great idea.</p>
<p>Jeff, put it on.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>No, Jeff! Britta, stop arguing.</p>
<p>If you have anything else to say, say it in a high-pitched voice while walking backwards.</p>
<p>Jeff is in grave danger.</p>
<p>Hee-hee! Uh, may I help you? I'm one of the impersonators.</p>
<p>Which one? - Do I have to say it? Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I don't believe anybody hired you to <span class="reference">Burt Reynolds</span>urt Reynolds.</p>
<p>Why not? - Do I have to say it? - May I help yo<span class="reference">Burt Reynolds</span>do.</p>
<p>Hmm, could be under "fat." </p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Go on in.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p>Abed, get back to your station.</p>
<p>I can't right now, I'm talking to Geena Davis.</p>
<p>Abed, we have to do this right or Vinnie won't clea<span class="reference">Geena Davis</span>.</p>
<p>Troy, who cares about money? Look around.</p>
<p>This is why we're alive.</p>
<p>Ooh, fake Lorenzo Lamas.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>I was so sad to hear of your passing.</p>
<p>M<span class="reference">Lorenzo Lamas</span>nt Chang, what are you doing here? Hey, Annie.</p>
<p>Just one of the perks when your brother's a rabbi.</p>
<p>He throws me some private security gigs at the events he officiates.</p>
<p>They can get really intense sometimes.</p>
<p>Can you believe some jerk brought a scalpel to a bris? Now smile.</p>
<p>Why is he out of his quadrant? I'm Lorenzo Lamas.</p>
<p>He's reenacting a movie.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>What movie were <span class="reference">Lorenzo Lamas</span>tis and Lorenzo Lamas in together? See, now I'm just em<span class="reference">Jamie Lee Curtis</span>u bec<span class="reference">Lorenzo Lamas</span>ever seen Lorenzo's Oil.</p>
<p>Lorenzo is an oil tycoon that gets his address book switched with Jamie Lee Curtis', and they give each other piggyback rides.</p>
<p>I can't believe did you go to college? Yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Keep working.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You are gorgeous! Would you look at this one.</p>
<p>He's like a Robert Redford.</p>
<p>No, no, more like a taller, hotter Ryan Seacrest.</p>
<p>It's amazing, you're actually more handsome than the guy who's famous for being handsome.</p>
<p>Skull Cracker 2000.</p>
<p>Top of the line.</p>
<p>Who wants to hold it? - Me! - That's so cool.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Dude, this is so sick.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>Any of you fine young men interested in a college credit? - Sure! - Right! Look, man, if you have a request, not a real DJ, okay.</p>
<p>These are just props.</p>
<p>You look like a friend of mine.</p>
<p>You're friends with Moby?  - Jeff! - Oh! I haven't been dipped like that since my last divor<span class="reference">Moby</span>Britta, you were right.</p>
<p>I can feel my ego taking over.</p>
<p>Do something! Okay, listen to me.</p>
<p>You are not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Do you understand? You have bad posture.</p>
<p>When you do to many push-ups, it looks like you have boobs.</p>
<p>The tile in your bathroom is tacky.</p>
<p>You were emotionally closed off in bed to the point where one time, I didn't come up because I couldn't find close enough parking.</p>
<p>You have an unusually high butt crack.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It couldn't have been easy for you to lie like that.</p>
<p>We are getting you out of here.</p>
<p>Get back to your quadrant.</p>
<p>Now! Britta! Honey, you were the highlight of the evening.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, you'd win every single award.</p>
<p>There's awards? Ladies and non-gentlemen, welcome to Howie Schwartz's Star Mitzvah Awards.</p>
<p>Here to present the first award are fake Morgan Freeman and fake Bono.</p>
<p>You know, fake Bono, algebra can be tough.<span class="reference">Morgan Freeman</span>fake Morga<span class="reference">Bono</span>eeman.</p>

<p>Jeff, I think that we should go.</p>

<p>Hey, Jimmy, wait up.<span class="reference">Hulk</span>gie Nights.</p>
<p>You're fat Burt Reynolds, right? I'll take it.</p>
<p>Abed, your<span class="reference">Boogie Nights</span>they do? Tell<span class="reference">Burt Reynolds</span>looked like! Doc, doc! Who's there? It's your femur bone.</p>
<p>He needs some money.</p>
<p>He's broke.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Laughter's the best medicine.</p>
<p>What are what are you doing? I'm challenging your entire medical establishment, sir.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>So we just spent our whole night paying off your debt, and you're blowing money on a Patch Adams? It's two for one.</p>
<p>We're doing Popeye next.</p>
<p>Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga.</p>
<p>Get him some spinach.</p>
<p>I'm Olive Oyl.</p>
<p>Get out! Are you mad at me? - No.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I was gonna go in the Dreamatorium and play Inspector Spacetime.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah? Come here.</p>
<p>I am mad at you.</p>
<p>You said you weren't.</p>
<p>We never lie.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>We made a deal.</p>
<p>October 15, 2009.</p>
<p>Friends don't lie to each other.</p>
<p>I know! I lied.</p>
<p>Because you don't like people who tell you what to do, and I don't want to be one of those people.</p>
<p>Then don't be.</p>
<p>I have to be.</p>
<p>You have to stop renting celebrity impersonators.</p>
<p>Vinnie was gonna break both of your legs.</p>
<p>I had to work really hard to help you.</p>
<p>But that's what you wanted to do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I can't do what I want to do? I guess not.</p>
<p>Not all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're just gonna have to trust - that I know better about stuff.</p>
<p>I don't know if I can do that.</p>
<p>Then I guess you're gonna have to trust that you're gonna have to trust me.</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to stop being your friend, so I guess I'll let you tell me what to do sometimes.</p>
<p>Still best friends? Yeah.</p>
<p>Still best friends.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>You still gonna go to the Dreamatorium? Oh, yeah, but I think I'm gonna play by myself right now, if that's okay.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Seacrest Hulk, you're the greatest! Whoo! You rock, Seacrest Hulk! I love you, Seacrest Hulk! You know, Seacrest Hulk, you're a meshugeneh.</p>
<p>You okay? No.</p>
<p>I ruined a Bar Mitzvah.</p>
<p>I'm a bad person.</p>
<p>What you're feeling is called shame.</p>
<p>It means you're getting better.</p>
<p>You're gonna be safe again once those pills wear off.</p>
<p>Um, I was thinking You know that person that you study for your psych class? Maybe that should be me.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>You are way out of my league, diagnostically speaking.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go with someone a little less complicated.</p>
<p>Like Abed.</p>
<p>Hi, Abed.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Where's Troy? In the other room.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>There are many advantages of traveling by yourself.</p>
<p>You can drive faster, change direction.</p>
<p>And the only pee breaks are yours.</p>
<p>Are you real? - Are you? This is really crazy.</p>
<p>And inaccessible, and maybe too dark.</p>
<p>Maybe to them, but not to us.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Hot.</p>
<p>Hot, hot, hot.</p>
