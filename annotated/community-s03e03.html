<div id="transcript">
<p>I really made my bones with that last collar, babe.</p>
<p>Today's the day.</p>
<p>You woke up with a guard this morning.</p>
<p>But tonight, you're going to bed with a detective.</p>
<p>ShhOkay, you get some rest, 'kay? Probably need it.</p>
<p>Here's Ben dressed like a dragon.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Here's me and Abed dressed as <span class="reference people">Nick Nolte</span> and <span class="reference people">Eddie Murphy</span>.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Who's <span class="reference people">Nick Nolte</span>? Aww.</p>
<p>Hey, Abed, can I borrow some change for the water fountain? Yeah.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Change? - Hey, Dean.</p>
<p>Hmm? What are you doing? Nothing after lunch.</p>
<p>And I can skip lunch if you want-- Oh.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Keeps tuition down and it saves on water, too.</p>
<p>That's because nobody's gonna pay to drink water.</p>
<p>Actually it's a two drink-minimum.</p>
<p>It'll be reflected in your tuition.</p>
<p>Hey, Dean.</p>
<p>Thanks for the new digs.</p>
<p>Ah, eh, remember what we talked about? We have to keep this whole living situation kind of quiet.</p>
<p>You know, on the d-low.</p>
<p>Sure, you know, I'm barely there.</p>
<p>I'm married to the job.</p>
<p>And to a mannequin leg I found in the boiler room.</p>
<p>Homewrecker.</p>
<p>Your first major lab assignment is to construct a terrarium.</p>
<p>Sort of like a diorama.</p>
<p>You guys have weird reactions to stuff.</p>
<p>Hey, can I ask you something? This is unrelated.</p>
<p>As someone who just finished spending the majority of his life in prison, what happened with legos? They used to be simple.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, I know you know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Legos were simple.</p>
<p>Something happened out here while I was inside.</p>
<p>Harry Potter legos, Star Wars legos.</p>
<p>Complicated kits, tiny little blocks.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not saying it's bad, I just wanna know what happened.</p>
<p>All right, fine.</p>
<p>Your terrariums are due tomorrow.</p>
<p>And everyone look across the table at the person in front of you.</p>
<p>That's your lab partner for the rest of the semester.</p>
<p>Saddle up.</p>
<p>Who are these people?</p>
<p>Um, hello, please, Professor Kane? Yes? I know you haven't been here at Greendale very long, but, um, we're a study group.</p>
<p>It's kind of a thing.</p>
<p>We've been through a lot.</p>
<p>You probably heard of the space bus.</p>
<p>Paintball.</p>
<p>I had sex with Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom, and these are the only guys I've ever told.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're like a family.</p>
<p>We love each other.</p>
<p>Second paintball.</p>
<p>What is happening at this school? I have so many conversations that make no sense.</p>
<p>Uh, we'd really prefer to partner up amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>It's not you, it's me.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to protect us both from more pain down the road.</p>
<p>I may have a developmental disorder.</p>
<p>I need to catch up on Breaki<span class="reference titles">Breaking Bad</span>'m so sorry.</p>
<p>I have a developmental disorder.</p>
<p>Star Wars, Star Wars.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You understand.</p>
<p>You're also, quite frankly, a very weird-looking man.</p>
<p>I don't know you, but I just don't trust you.</p>
<p>And I don't think I could grow to like you.</p>
<p>The point of what I'm trying to tell you, Todd, is that I don't want to be your lab partner.</p>
<p>No offense.</p>
<p>None taken.</p>
<p>I understand, you wanna be with your friends.</p>
<p>Don't tell me what I'm feeling or thinking.</p>
<p>It's petty.</p>
<p>Good-bye, Todd.</p>
<p>Okay, how are we gonna divide the-- Hey, Todd! Todd, buddy! You passed the test.</p>
<p>I've been walking my beat a long time, sir.</p>
<p>A long time.</p>
<p>I've kept my head down, paid my dues.</p>
<p>And, well, I think I'm ready to make detective.</p>
<p>You've only been here a month.</p>
<p>You really haven't done much of anything.</p>
<p>And there's no such thing as security guard detective.</p>
<p>We don't solve crimes.</p>
<p>We barely prevent them.</p>
<p>You wanna detect something? Do it on your own time.</p>
<p>Maybe I will.</p>
<p>"Maybe I will." </p>
<p>My own words rang in my head like a bell inside a head.</p>
<p>Maybe I was crazy.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, I was a detective.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What? - Looking for something? - No.</p>
<p>She said she wasn't, but her eyes said otherwise.</p>
<p>She was all dame, legs that went all the way to the bottom of her torso.</p>
<p>The kind of arms that had elbows.</p>
<p>UmDid you just call me in here to stare at me? The way she left, I could tell that somebody-- or something--had really put the scare on her.</p>
<p>But what? Why? Stapler.</p>
<p>Was I crazy? Or were they somehow connected? I can't believe it.</p>
<p>This is the first time there hasn't been a beetle in here.</p>
<p>Should we move outside? - Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Did you even hear what I said? - Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Seriously? Is this what it's gonna be like working together? What? I lost three followers? Man, people just can't handle the truth about Ben Sherman's winter collection.</p>
<p>Roommates, study group, lab partners.</p>
<p>We really are gonna spend all our time together.</p>
<p>How awesome is that? Very.</p>
<p>You know what else is awesome? Last night I saw the Hong Kong movie.</p>
<p>That Kickpuncher is based on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, I was there.</p>
<p>Did you see the scene where Kickpuncher kick-punches Yeah.</p>
<p>Both of them.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>We spend too much time together.</p>
<p>Jinx.</p>
<p>Here's Ben with his cupcake.</p>
<p>And here he is a few seconds later when he was crying because he dropped his cupcake.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And here he is with another cupcake.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, wait, these pictures are out of order.</p>
<p>That's the same cupcake.</p>
<p>Oh, Shirley, these pictures are adorable.</p>
<p>And comprehensive.</p>
<p>But did you know that sugar is like baby meth? That's what my homeopath said.</p>
<p>Well, maybe your gay friend should mind his own business.</p>
<p>"Forget about the girl," I told myself. "Let her go, like a lobster claw letting go of a small balloon for lobsters." </p>
<p>Still, I had a hunch.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>A matchbook.</p>
<p>Something about it seemed clue-y.</p>
<p>"Arizona matchbook company." </p>
<p>Arizona.</p>
<p>Arizona backwards is still Arizona! It's a palomino! Maybe I was crazy Or maybe I was finally sane.</p>
<p>Why does this guy keep staring at me? Britta.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? Oh, I was just getting some air.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>And wondering something.</p>
<p>I was wondering something, too.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>No, you first.</p>
<p>I was wondering, what would it be like - if we were partners? - What's going on here? Were you thinking of changing partners? Who's thinking of changing partners? Were you gonna bail on me? No.</p>
<p>No one here is thinking of changing partners.</p>
<p>No, sir.</p>
<p>I am! While he was spying, I found a turtle.</p>
<p>It's not fair that I should be the only one here saddled with a total waste of space loser.</p>
<p>No offense, Todd.</p>
<p>None taken.</p>
<p>Why should you all get the exact partner you wanted? That's right.</p>
<p>It's totally not fair that we saddled Pierce with Todd.</p>
<p>We should probably choose partners again.</p>
<p>I mean, just to be fair.</p>
<p>So it's agreed.</p>
<p>Let's go to the study room and deal with this Todd problem once and for all.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, did you want me to come? Um, it's called "the Todd problem." </p>
<p>Okay, we just have to come up with a fair way to decide who is gonna be stuck for an entire semester with this Random.</p>
<p>This, uh, non-grouper.</p>
<p>No offense, Todd.</p>
<p>None taken.</p>
<p>I'm happy to work with whoever.</p>
<p>There's only one way to decide this fairly.</p>
<p>We go boy-girl, boy-girl.</p>
<p>But everyone has to have a different hair color.</p>
<p>And be from a different high school.</p>
<p>And be a different race.</p>
<p>I guess I'd be with Britta.</p>
<p>I guess my--my hands are tied.</p>
<p>The hair color concept intrigues me because it's how I distinguish you anyway.</p>
<p>But what if we arrange by age, so that way the young people can work while the old people sleep and vice versa.</p>
<p>Um, I-I was just wondering who you considered old, because I'd like to remind you again that I'm just about the same age as Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh, I was counting Jeff as old, too.</p>
<p>Hey! Oh, well, that's all right then.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how my age has anything to-- Oh, for heaven's sake, Pierce! I was thinking the thing that would be most beneficial-- you know, for the group-- would be to pair the people with the lowest GPAs with the highest.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>The highest carrying the lowest? I can see how you might want that.</p>
<p>You know what, Annie? Pew, pew, pew, pew, p-- Wait, no.</p>
<p>Pew, pew, pew, pew.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have kids? Because I have a gorgeous little newborn that I'd like to get-- Oh, perfect! You'll enjoy talking to Shirley about her kids.</p>
<p>Uh-uh, don't go trying to pawn Todd off on me.</p>
<p>Again, none taken.</p>
<p>Guys, our terrariums are due tomorrow and it's already nine.</p>
<p>Okay, let's make this simple and do it like student housing.</p>
<p>Everyone write down their lab partner preferences from one to eight.</p>
<p>Abed, you're a computer.</p>
<p>You figure out a way to put us in our optimal pairings.</p>
<p>And before you all go putting Todd down last, don't forget he comes with a turtle.</p>
<p>You're halfway done.</p>
<p>How does that sound? Somebody wake up Pierce.</p>
<p>Hello, Arizona matchbook company.</p>
<p>I had to get some answers.</p>
<p>And I needed answers like a fish needs a bicycle-- A lot.</p>
<p>Hello? Hello? Yeah, I am, uh, interested in your matchbooks.</p>
<p>Yes, would you like to place an order? I had to think fast.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Get away from my desk.</p>
<p>I'll call you back.</p>
<p>You've been walking around campus asking people weird questions and then staring at them while slightly moving your lips? I had to think fast.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ben I think this job might be getting to you.</p>
<p>I think you need to take some time off.</p>
<p>Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Very much so.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right, yep.</p>
<p>According to my system, Annie's gonna be with Shirley.</p>
<p>Pierce is with me.</p>
<p>Troy is with Britta.</p>
<p>And Jeff is with Todd.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get to work.</p>
<p>Uh, wait.</p>
<p>Um, how did I end up with Todd? I mean, no offense, but he wasn't exactly at the top of my list.</p>
<p>None taken.</p>
<p>It's what the algorithm dictated.</p>
<p>And we're just supposed to trust your algorithm? You're questioning my algorithm? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Is your algorithm above questioning? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Will you just tell us how you chose? I used the ballots to rank everyone by popularity.</p>
<p>And I put the most popular with the least popular.</p>
<p>I figured it would maximize each partnership's audience appeal.</p>
<p>Oh, I-I see.</p>
<p>So I was number one, and he was obviously number eight.</p>
<p>No offense, Todd.</p>
<p>You and Todd were four and five.</p>
<p>I was four? - Todd was four.</p>
<p>I was five? Well, that's insane! We don't even know him.</p>
<p>He's a stranger.</p>
<p>Please, Jeff.</p>
<p>It has feelings.</p>
<p>Wait, so we all know Annie was number one, because she'd do all the work.</p>
<p>And Shirley was her partner, so But that means-- so you all put-- I just worked it out.</p>
<p>I'm more popular than someone! Getting the matchbooks shipped to me the same day wasn't easy.</p>
<p>I had to pay the company money.</p>
<p>I used Nunez's card.</p>
<p>He'd thank me at the Detective Awards.</p>
<p>Somewhere, somehow, I was gonna find what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Holy Mary, mother of God.</p>
<p>Was I crazy? Or was I on the verge of something? My mind reeled with thoughts.</p>
<p>Voices.</p>
<p>Stand-up premises.</p>
<p>Why don't they just make tires out of pavement so you can drive on anything? What's up with buttons? What would happen if Nicholson was a gynecologist? There was something there.</p>
<p>I need a notepad.</p>
<p>Maybe a blazer.</p>
<p>Honey, I-I-I don't know when I'll be home.</p>
<p>How could you guys hate me more than Pierce? Or anything more than Pierce? Thin ice, Shirley.</p>
<p>My friends and I are not gonna let you drive a wedge between us.</p>
<p>Shirley has a point.</p>
<p>This list stinks like a butt convention.</p>
<p>How else could you explain Troy being so unpopular? Uh, I think I was the popular one in our pairing.</p>
<p>Oh, Troy.</p>
<p>Fine, why don't I just go work with Todd? Hey, that's cool, whatever gets this project done.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, what a great guy.</p>
<p>I can see why all of you like him so much more than me.</p>
<p>Jeff, maybe it's just that no one wants to carry you all year.</p>
<p>Gee, you're right, Annie, it's not personal.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not like people really like you.</p>
<p>You're just a good grade in a tight sweater.</p>
<p>You're just a bad grade in a tight sweater.</p>
<p>And who the hell are you always texting? Everyone you know is here.</p>
<p>Okay, let's all just take a breath-- Don't get your number four stink on this, Todd.</p>
<p>Okay, let's focus.</p>
<p>We're all the same people we were 12 hours ago.</p>
<p>Maybe we should just revert to our original pairings.</p>
<p>But I thought you didn't want to carry Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh, you just don't want to work with Shirley.</p>
<p>You too, brute? It's just You're a creationist! - What? - You're so religious.</p>
<p>How are you gonna do science experiments if you don't even believe in science? Just because someone's religious doesn't mean they have a problem with science.</p>
<p>And certainly, if an introductory biology course at a community college can refute 2,000 years of miracles-- And what about Britta? She's not gonna dissect anything.</p>
<p>Fine, you got me, I won't dissect anything with a face.</p>
<p>What about worms? Do they have tiny little faces? This is why you're the stupidest! If loving worms is stupid, I don't wanna be smart.</p>
<p>It is, and you can't be.</p>
<p>Guys, I just figured it all out.</p>
<p>Pierce, wake up, Jeff is gonna heal us.</p>
<p>We have been looking at this totally wrong.</p>
<p>There's no way I'm unpopular.</p>
<p>One of you monsters just put me last in a petty attempt to humble me.</p>
<p>Oh! I just had a terrible nightmare that Jeff was a pompous ass.</p>
<p>Also Todd was there.</p>
<p>Uh, no offense, Todd.</p>
<p>I'd poked my nose where it didn't belong.</p>
<p>Someone--or something-- had sent me a message.</p>
<p>Veronica.</p>
<p>It was my fault she had gotten mixed up in all this.</p>
<p>Uh-uh, Todd.</p>
<p>Pretty sure I heard a fire alarm.</p>
<p>Nobody's going home until we see those ballots.</p>
<p>See the ballots? Are you crazy? I say let's lay our cards on the table and see what everyone really thinks of each other.</p>
<p>Get behind me, Abed.</p>
<p>Jeff, stop it! Pass! Give it to me! No, get back, get back! I am doing this for all of us.</p>
<p>Oh, no, she's got her marijuana lighter.</p>
<p>Don't! Noooo! The turtle is in there! Oh, my God, I am so sorry! What is wrong with you people? Huh? I thought you were supposed to be friends! I thought you were supposed to love each other! Your love is weird.</p>
<p>And toxic! And it destroys everything it touches! I no longer care about grades.</p>
<p>Or biology.</p>
<p>Or finally graduating from college, like I promised my dying father.</p>
<p>I'm going home.</p>
<p>I'm gonna hold my wife and my child close.</p>
<p>And I am gonna finally take my Insulin shot! Offense taken.</p>
<p>Offense taken.</p>
<p>Well, he is right about one thing.</p>
<p>You're all terrible people.</p>
<p>And I don't care about this stupid assignment.</p>
<p>I'm going home.</p>
<p>No, I'm not, I'm going to biology class.</p>
<p>It starts in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And eventually, this caterpillar will come out of its cocoon.</p>
<p>And then-- Pop, pop! Nice work, you two.</p>
<p>You know they're laughing at you, right? I mean, that's my theory.</p>
<p>Now, super group.</p>
<p>I can't help but notice a sorry lack of terrariums.</p>
<p>We didn't have time to finish.</p>
<p>Here's mine.</p>
<p>When did you even have time to do that? You're pathological.</p>
<p>It's too late for flattery.</p>
<p>Professor, obviously this isn't working out.</p>
<p>You're just gonna have to put us with our original lab partners.</p>
<p>All right? - I don't have to do anything.</p>
<p>Not after you broke my boy Todd.</p>
<p>That man called me crying this morning.</p>
<p>You know he fought in Iraq, right? We had a name for people like you in prison.</p>
<p>We called you "the mean clique." </p>
<p>But I have a solution.</p>
<p>All seven of you will share a microscope, one bench, and one grade that I will average.</p>
<p>Everyone else gets their own stuff.</p>
<p>So can we get an extension on the first assignment? No.</p>
<p>You all fail.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>How did this happen? And did I miss the firemen? Dean, the explanation is simple.</p>
<p>It's all connected.</p>
<p>A web of conspiracy that goes all the way to the top of Arizona.</p>
<p>All Right.</p>
<p>Hey, somebody's been squatting in the utility closet.</p>
<p>There's a hot plate back there, thousands of matches.</p>
<p>I mean, we're looking at dozens of major health and fire code violations.</p>
<p>I think we're gonna have to get the police involved.</p>
<p>And that's when it hit me.</p>
<p>I was in really big trouble.</p>
<p>Dean.</p>
<p>Dean? Oh, uhNo.</p>
<p>No need to get the cops.</p>
<p>With a conspiracy this big, they're probably involved.</p>
<p>What? - What Chang says makes a lot of sense, and, um, okay, you know what? I quit.</p>
<p>I mean, I can deal with the not getting paid, but I draw the line at you enabling this man.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm seriously concerned that he's mentally ill.</p>
<p>And--and it's not funny at all.</p>
<p>It's scary.</p>
<p>The top of Arizona - I needed to know more.</p>
<p>Was it a very high mesa? - About those firemen.</p>
<p>Or was it a state of mind? - Were they ethnically diverse? - Either way, I was going - Did they bring a dalmatian? - To have to climb it.</p>
<p>Could I buy a calendar? Okay, screw this.</p>
<p>I-I quit.</p>
<p>Hmm? Well, it seems that Greendale owes you a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>How would you like to be the new head of security? I had to think fast.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don't know, was I crazy? Or was I just doing right by the school? - This is awkward, isn't it? - Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I think it's pretty clear what destroyed the balance in our study group's ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ranking one person above another.</p>
<p>Letting our differences get the bets of us.</p>
<p>Racism? - No.</p>
<p>Todd.</p>
<p>Todd! Did you see the head on that guy? "None taken." </p>
<p>What was wrong with him? Not to be unchristian, but that boy sucked.</p>
<p>I missed this.</p>
<p>Aww! And his dumb baby! - I know! - On and on.</p>
<p>He wouldn't shut up.</p>
<p>These questions are really personal.</p>
<p>Are you sure this is anonymous? Yeah, they're just practice evaluations for my psych class.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Who did a butt? They're boobs.</p>
<p>And I don't know.</p>
<p>Take it again.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Somebody drew a penis.</p>
<p>Oh! And another penis.</p>
<p>Penis, penis, penis.</p>
<p>Very mature, guys.</p>
<p>I didn't draw a penis.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>Yeah, these are all normally filled out tests.</p>
<p>Ha ha! Gotcha! This was also a test, and you all penised.</p>
<p>Passed.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to take one.</p>
<p>A test.</p>
<p>Not a penis.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
