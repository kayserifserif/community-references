<p>And we're back.</p>
<p>Welcome, students, new and old , to another fall semester at Greendale.</p>
<p>It's time for clean slates and fresh starts.</p>
<p>Celebrate your fresh start tonight at the Fresh-Start Dance in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>The same cafeteria where Britta Perry professed her love to Jeff Winger who then walked out on her.</p>
<p>Unforgettable.</p>
<p>Plus, free punch and Fresh-Start cookies tonight at the Fresh-Start Dance.</p>
<p>Look at us, living together, driving to school together.</p>
<p>I know, we're like <span class="reference">Batman</span> and <span class="reference">Shaft</span>.</p>
<p><span class="reference">Batman</span> actually had a guy.</p>
<p>His name was Robin.</p>
<p>He rode around with him.</p>
<p>Troy, <span class="reference">Batman</span>'s friend didn't have to be Robin, he could've been <span class="reference">Shaft</span>, Dolemite, Leroy Brown.</p>
<p>Don't let society limit your people.</p>
<p>"Batman and Shaft," wow.</p>
<p>Reading Troy's Twitter where he posts everything Pierce says? Yeah, it's hilarious.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hello, Annie.</p>
<p>I like your hair.</p>
<p>Thank you, Abed.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, hello.</p>
<p>How was your summer? I live with you.</p>
<p>How was your summer?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>It's good to be back here.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you guys ready for whatever Anthropology is? We should wait for Britta.</p>
<p>Do we know she's coming back? She never returned my calls or e-mails.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>It's not gonna be the same without her.</p>
<p>Did you guys see Toy Story 3? Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, I loved Toy Story 3.</p>
<p>It was amazing, I love --</p>
<p>Hey! Whoa! Oh! Hey, Toy Story Britta.</p>
<p>How's it going? Okay, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I made an ass of myself and Jeff at that dance.</p>
<p>I was caught up in a competition with his ex-girlfriend, and I wish I could erase the entire night.</p>
<p>And I owe you an apology.</p>
<p>I accept.</p>
<p>You don't owe us anything and you don't have to hide from us.</p>
<p>You? I'm hiding from them.</p>
<p>It's like high school all over again.</p>
<p>Psycho Britta, the walking freak show for every Barbie with a Co<span class="reference">Barbie</span>bscription.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be a tool, but you embarrassed me too, so call it karma.</p>
<p>Boy, I hope I'm not around when you do mean to be a tool.</p>
<p>Let's just put this behind us and just walk to class, okay? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're Britta Perry? Yeah, what's it to you? You're the coolest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, at what exactly? Being fearless, honest, speaking from your heart.</p>
<p>"Jeff Winger, I love you." </p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>My heart may have overstated --</p>
<p>Do you sign stuff?</p>
<p>Now and again.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I don't like where that's going.</p>
<p>I know, right? Look, um, remember the little talk we had? The one about discretion? Yes.</p>
<p>Stop that.</p>
<p>We agreed you and I kissing was a mistake.</p>
<p>If anyone were to find out, I would be tarred, feathered, and put on websites people check when buying a house.</p>
<p>It's forgotten, Jeff, jeez.</p>
<p>I'm not some love-struck teenybopper.</p>
<p>But we didn't just kiss, we Frenched.</p>
<p>I checked the make-out meter in this month's issue of National Review.</p>
<p>I don't like where that's going.</p>
<p>Señor Chang.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, I guess it's not señor anymore.</p>
<p>What should we call you? Student Chang? Two-Credits-Into-a-Music-Major Chang? How about not calling me anything? Why are you guys in this class? We chose it together.</p>
<p>The real question is, why are you in it? Oh, you missed us? Don't flatter yourself.</p>
<p>Have you checked the course description? Ancient weaponry.</p>
<p>Genital mutilation.</p>
<p>This subject's talking my Chang-uage.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>Star-Burns has grown reliant on his sideburns but craves identity beyond them, so he added a hat.</p>
<p>No, what's up with Britta mania? Oh, that's even simpler.</p>
<p>Britta put herself out there and you walked away, making her the underdog, the Aniston.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have any hillbilly cousins? I wish, why? A wealthy uncle, or buddy that may have had a sex change? Why are you mining my life for sitcom scenarios? I'm excited about the year, looking to improve.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we can move away from the relationship-y stuff into fast-paced escapades.</p>
<p>What is it exactly that separates man from animal? Divorce.</p>
<p>Tools.</p>
<p>Like this blowgun I used to hunt monkeys with the Korubo in the Amazon.</p>
<p>My name is Professor June Bauer, and this semester I will guide you to the threshold of your humanity where you will lock eyes with the shrieking, blood-drenched, sister-raping beasts from which we sprang.</p>
<p>You will also have to make a diorama.</p>
<p>For your first assignment, I would like you to form tribes of no more than eight, and if you can, mix up the races.</p>
<p>You'll be surprised at how quickly things get awkward.</p>
<p>Now that Troy's off the streets and living with me, he's learning about the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tell me again why Jewish people wear yarmulkes.</p>
<p>Half a hat, saves money.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>"Half a hat"? That is so offensive.</p>
<p>I love Old White Man Says.</p>
<p>Find an eighth dork for your tribe of dorks? I think you took Anthropology because you wanna be in our group but are too proud to ask.</p>
<p>Keep dreaming, Winger.</p>
<p>Would somebody with too much pride do this? Current balance: $23.</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>Consider yourself Chang'd.</p>
<p>Mac and cheese, please.</p>
<p>Sorry, looks like your food just walked out on you.</p>
<p>Same way you did Britta.</p>
<p>Hey, can we talk? Oh, now he wants to talk.</p>
<p>No, it's fine, I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Man, you got some passionate fans.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>It'll blow over.</p>
<p>Well, would you mind helping it blow over? My stock is kind of plummeting around here.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't mean to sound like a tool, but maybe it's karma.</p>
<p>I know you're excited to be popular with women, but don't get too high on your own drama.</p>
<p>High on my own drama?! The people's champion.</p>
<p>Sorry, man, I gotta go where the heat is.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger, you're a jerk.</p>
<p>She's turned every woman against me.</p>
<p>Not every woman, not the one that deserves to be with you.</p>
<p>All women deserve to be with me, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Granted, but who doesn't eventually settle down? I don't, and I never will.</p>
<p>And if I did If I did, I could beat Britta at her own game.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Yeah, you better take a hike.</p>
<p>Do you know where the cleanest bathroom is? Teacher's lounge.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Don't be shy, come on up, have a sip.</p>
<p>The yogi of India swear by its restorative powers.</p>
<p>Okay, more of my urine for me.</p>
<p>Now for your tribe's assignment.</p>
<p>This box contains nine different tools, all of them important to humanity's survival.</p>
<p>One of them is the most important of all.</p>
<p>Your tribe's assignment for tomorrow is to tell me which tool that is.</p>
<p>Questions? I have a question.</p>
<p>But not for you.</p>
<p>It's for Britta.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I know this puts you in an awkwardly powerful position, but I have to know, right now, in front of everyone, do you love me too? More than anything in the world.</p>
<p>Really? Yeah.</p>
<p>So it begins.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>The greatest relationship ever known.</p>
<p>This is making me sick.</p>
<p>I'm gonna love you forever.</p>
<p>Good, I'm gonna love you forever.</p>
<p>I don't believe you.</p>
<p>Why, don't you want me to? No, I do.</p>
<p>Bring it.</p>
<p>Doesn't it make you wanna cry? Something like that.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I downloaded a song that makes me think of you.</p>
<p>Let's listen to it, each using one ear bud.</p>
<p>Would you consider spinning off with me? We could open a hair salon.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Is this you being meta? I wanted to come out having adventures, like paintball.</p>
<p>This is boring.</p>
<p>That's selfish, Abed.</p>
<p>If you were a friend, you would see their relationship as an adventure.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about it that way.</p>
<p>Oh! Look at how they walk.</p>
<p>Clearly, the most important tool is the cross, representing Christianity.</p>
<p>It's an ax.</p>
<p>It's an ax? Maybe the telescope.</p>
<p>Look through it backwards, shrink your enemies.</p>
<p>I'll show you the tool that's most important to our survival, but fair warning, it's my penis.</p>
<p>Old White Man.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>I was in my car loving Britta.</p>
<p>I just love you too much.</p>
<p>Not half as much as me.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Do you think you'll marry Britta? I'd like to see someone stop me.</p>
<p>I just peed a little.</p>
<p>Then here, propose.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I got it, I got it, got it.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger, will you marry me? Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Perfect, I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord.</p>
<p>I was so worried about your souls, ever since you had pre-marital sex on the table.</p>
<p>Oh! Awesome.</p>
<p>You told Shirley? No need for secrecy now.</p>
<p>It was during the paintball game.</p>
<p>Was there anything you didn't win that day? Oh, my God! You slept with her and then kissed me? What?</p>
<p># Now they're in so deep #</p>
<p># You know she's such a fool for him #</p>
<p># She has a ring around her finger #</p>
<p># And Abed hired an Irish singer #</p>
<p># Britta's marrying, Britta's marrying #</p>
<p># Britta's marrying Jeffrey Winger #</p>
<p>What the hell is this? A wedding episode.</p>
<p>Abed, there's no wedding.</p>
<p>Cold feet? Talk with your best man, George Clooney.</p>
<p>What's up? H<span class="reference">George Clooney</span>nator.</p>
<p>But still razzle-dazzle, right? Abed.</p>
<p>Hmm? Jeff made out with Annie.</p>
<p>What? When? Where? Yeah, where? That's inappropriate.</p>
<p>I'm assuming on the mouth.</p>
<p>After the Transfer Dance.</p>
<p>I tell you that I love you, then you go and stick your tongue into a teenager? What is wrong with you, Jeffrey? Shirley, since you have clearly failed to grasp the central insipid metaphor of those Twilight books you devour, let me explain it to you.</p>
<p>Men are monsters who crave young flesh, the end.</p>
<p>At least we have the decency to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>Instead of blurting "I love you" to everyone who sleeps with us.</p>
<p>Oh, please, I never loved you.</p>
<p>Ah-ha! I win, I win, I win.</p>
<p>In your face.</p>
<p>So this was all a game? Everything they do is some sick competition.</p>
<p>Like you hate competition.</p>
<p>How long did it take you to kiss Jeff after I told him I loved him? First Vaughn, now Jeff.</p>
<p>I better not smile at that wall outlet or you'll fry your tongue off! Way to hog all the girls.</p>
<p>When there's three doughnuts, don't eat one and lick another.</p>
<p>Anyone object to us being referred to as doughnuts? Sorry we can't all be as honorable as you and post Pierce quotes all day on Twitter.</p>
<p>Wow, is that your lame attempt to try and pass the hot seat to me? Nice try.</p>
<p>Wait, I'm Old White Man Says? No wonder he says everything I'm thinking.</p>
<p>You bastard.</p>
<p>I'm just sharing what you say.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, what if I shared all the stuff you say? He thinks all dogs are boys and all cats are girls.</p>
<p>There's no way to disprove that.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a cat penis? Where you going? By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you canceled.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Yeah, Abed, cancel us.</p>
<p>Why don't you take your cutesy "I can't tell life from TV" gimmick with you? You know, it's very "season one." </p>
<p>I can tell life from TV, Jeff.</p>
<p>TV makes sense, it has structure, logic, rules, and likable leading men.</p>
<p>In life, we have this.</p>
<p>We have you.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>I'm on the clock for another hour if you want me to do some Batman lines.</p>
<p>Not sitting with your little group? The group is done.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, missionary accomplished, right? What does that mean? Come on, I know you and Britta did it.</p>
<p>Isn't the reason you got with those people because you wanted to bang the blond? Now I hear that you Frenched the brunette.</p>
<p>What more could you have gotten out of that group? Good morning, class.</p>
<p>Let's dive in and hear the results of your assignment.</p>
<p>Who wants to go first? I don't know, Mr. Winger, the last time I called on you, I kind of got what the Maku-Maku call "dirt-roaded." </p>
<p>Using it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p>Come on up.</p>
<p>It was a trick question.</p>
<p>The tool most important to humanity's survival wasn't any of the nine in the box.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>The most important tool is respect.</p>
<p>Ha! Gay.</p>
<p>And the reason I know respect is a tool is because it is clearly not a natural thing and we forget to use it all the time.</p>
<p>And then we start competing with each other, exploiting each other, humiliating each other and controlling each other.</p>
<p>And we lose each other.</p>
<p>And without each other, we'll go extinct.</p>
<p>And that's a fact.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>A gay fact.</p>
<p>That's my answer, professor.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, that's one answer.</p>
<p>Here's the one I had in mind.</p>
<p>Combining all nine tools, you get this, a deadlier weapon than any one item in the box.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna use this to attack you, and you use respect to defend yourself.</p>
<p>Uh, oh, uh, --</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>I respect you.</p>
<p>That's why you fail.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>He's passing out.</p>
<p>Stay with us, buddy.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>What happened? Professor Bauer got suspended, and we got an A on our assignment.</p>
<p>Did someone throw urine in my face? I surprise myself under pressure.</p>
<p>Jeff, about the assignment, we decided you had the right answer.</p>
<p>We need more respect and a little less passion.</p>
<p>Which will be easy because I think you're gross now.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I'm gonna delete that Twitter account.</p>
<p>Your friendship is more important than 600,000 strangers.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Are you saying 600,000 people read what I say on Twitter? Well, we gotta cash in on that.</p>
<p>How about Old White Man Says, the TV Show?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Who would watch that? Speaking of bad development strategy, I owe you an apology.</p>
<p>I was trying so hard to make our week great, I didn't realize something great.</p>
<p>An old woman drinking her own pee.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Guys? I took Anthropology because I wanna be a part of your study group.</p>
<p>Now I gotta do the honest thing and just ask.</p>
<p>Is there any room in this pocket for a little spare Chang? Uh, look, we've been through a lot today.</p>
<p>Give us a little time to think it over.</p>
<p>Totally, man.</p>
<p>Just think about it.</p>
<p>Take your time and let me know.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>See you, Chang.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Poor guy.</p>
<p>We'll let him in eventually.</p>
<p>Says who? We have the strength to survive anything.</p>
<p>What's the worst that can happen? Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>I told you they hate you.</p>
<p>No, they said they just needed more time.</p>
<p>Time? They destroyed your life.</p>
<p>How much time before we take revenge? But they're my friends.</p>
<p>I'm your only friend.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No!</p>
