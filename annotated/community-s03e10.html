<div id="transcript">
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>They found a way to make the human being even creepier.</p>
<p>Covering him in icicles.</p>
<p>I think it's festive.</p>
<p>Yeah, my favorite Christmas tradition is trimming the hellraiser.</p>
<p>Guys, I found something we can watch together for Christmas this year.</p>
<p>The long-lost 1981 Inspector Spacetime Holiday Special.</p>
<p>Runtime two and half hours and so critically reviled that after it aired, the creator has his knighthood revoked.</p>
<p>That sounds terrible.</p>
<p>I want to watch it twice, but I'm spending Christmas with my relatives.</p>
<p>Or rather, I'm spending the day with my relatives while they refuse to acknowledge Christmas.</p>
<p>You Jehovah's Witnesses-- so severe.</p>
<p>Andre and I will be spending Christmas giving gifts to the more persuadable of our Jewish friends.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call an unannounced visit from your pastor "a gift." </p>
<p>And don't bother this year.</p>
<p>I'll be at the movies with my bubbe.</p>
<p>You're not taking both of them? Well, one's dead.</p>
<p>What? - I was looking forward to hanging out with you guys this Christmas.</p>
<p>This semester has been so long and dark and angry.</p>
<p>I was thinking we could have some light-hearted fun as a family.</p>
<p>I think what we've learned, Abed, is that attempts to make the holidays brighter tend to give them a certain darkness.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know if I agree with that.</p>
<p>Deck the halls with boughs of holly --</p>
<p>Actually, maybe I do.</p>
<p>Heads up.</p>
<p>Glee club.</p>
<p># 'Tis the season to be jolly #</p>
<p># Fa la la la la la la rock on! #</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Greendale.</p>
<p>Glee club here, reminding you that our Christmas pageant is coming.</p>
<p>Next stop, regionals!</p>
<p># I said deck -- #</p>
<p>Please tell me we were not this obnoxious the year we filled in for them.</p>
<p>T-minus five seconds till hip-hop remix.</p>
<p>Four, three.</p>
<p># Come on! #</p>
<p># Re-re-re-remix! #</p>
<p># Re-re-re-remix! #</p>
<p># Fa la la la la f-a l-a #</p>
<p># Come on whoo #</p>
<p>You're awfully quiet, Jeff.</p>
<p>Nobody hates glee club more than you.</p>
<p>Today I'm just content to sit back and enjoy the show.</p>
<p>And now our pop music mash-up! Elton Lil' Jo<span class="reference">John Lennon</span>Glee club girls: Kick it! Hey, tiny dancer! Okay! Stop! Cease and desist.</p>
<p>Glee club, meet ASCAP, protecting musical copyrights since 1914.</p>
<p>It appears they have received an anonymous tip that unlicensed material was being performed here without the artists' permission.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, everyone.</p>
<p>Glee club just became history club.</p>
<p>My soul is dead! Oh! Okay, if anyone asks, we were never here.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The glee club is at Westside Hospital, recuperating from a collective nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>This is the second glee club we've lost in two years.</p>
<p>We might have to cancel the Christmas pageant.</p>
<p>And to think they were this close to regionals.</p>
<p>What the hell are regionals? They're this close, Pierce.</p>
<p>Anyway, an old friend wants to talk to you.</p>
<p>Your favorite glee club instructor, the dreamy and boyish Mr. Cory Radison! Oh!</p>
<p>Uh, I thought I told you to call me Mr. Rad.</p>
<p>Or Cory.</p>
<p>Just don't call me "late to dinner." Unless you're serving brussels sprouts!</p>
<p>I won't, I promise! This guy's like human froyo.</p>
<p>Look, when the last glee club died in that bus crash, you guys stepped up.</p>
<p>And you were the best gosh darn emergency substitutes I've ever worked with.</p>
<p>Both: Aw! Well, this time I'm not gonna kid you.</p>
<p>I won't be easy.</p>
<p>Oh! - Your best Won't be good enough.</p>
<p>And ten times your best will be so bad, I will yell at you.</p>
<p>But I promise, if we dig down-- - Pass.</p>
<p>All: Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>Don't you hurt him.</p>
<p>Mr. Rad! I feel like we let Mr. Rad down.</p>
<p>No, he let himself down when he left the house this morning wearing a sweater-vest.</p>
<p>I guess we did have fun last time.</p>
<p>Did we? I can hardly remember.</p>
<p>It's all a weird, happy, musical fog.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was almost like being on ecstasy, only instead of having pointless conversations and dancing like idiots-- wait.</p>
<p>It was exactly like being on ecstasy! That's what worries me about this guy.</p>
<p>He is equal parts hanson and manson.</p>
<p>Nobody let him corner you until he is out of recruitment mode, or next thing you know, we'll all be caring about Christmas pageants and Regionals.</p>
<p>You're right, deal.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Got you.</p>
<p>What the hell are regionals?</p>
<p>What are you still doing here? I thought I'd give her one more tinkle before I took down decorations.</p>
<p>No glee club means no pageant, means no Christmas.</p>
<p>I'm sure trying to make things brighter just would've made more darkness.</p>
<p>That sounds like a certain ex-lawyer talking.</p>
<p>I see a lot of myself in you, Abed.</p>
<p>You care about your friends, and you wish they cared more about each other.</p>
<p>That's not an easy position to be in sometimes.</p>
<p>I just want my friends and I to have a merry Christmas together.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you could start by giving them the greatest Christmas gift of all.</p>
<p>What's that? Glee!</p>
<p># It's a feeling you get #</p>
<p># When your brain finally lets your heart get in its pants #</p>
<p># Glee! #</p>
<p># It's like a drug that you use #</p>
<p># That turns pain into shoes #</p>
<p># And your shoes into dance #</p>
<p>How's your piano still playing this song?</p>
<p># Glee is the answer #</p>
<p># When questions are wrong #</p>
<p># You'll understand if you just sing along #</p>
<p># 'Cause glee is the gift #</p>
<p># That you need #</p>
<p># Glee is what I'll spread to my friends #</p>
<p># Like a virus that sends them to a healthier place #</p>
<p># Glee! I'll understand every scene #</p>
<p># Because they'll sing what they mean #</p>
<p># Instead of making a face #</p>
<p># Families are closer when families are winning #</p>
<p># Everything's cooler when cameras are spinning #</p>
<p># Singing and dancing in unison #</p>
<p># In-inning #</p>
<p># Glee is the gift #</p>
<p># That we need #</p>
<p># Glee! #</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Rad.</p>
<p>Don't break down the set yet.</p>
<p>I'm gonna try to get my friends to be in the Christmas pageant.</p>
<p>Thank you, Abed! Thank you.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Troy.</p>
<p>Abed, you look gleeful.</p>
<p>Troy, don't you think it might actually be fun, doing this Christmas pageant for the glee club? Abed, we hate the glee club.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I just like liking things.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Look, you know I'd do anything you did, but -</p>
<p>I'm a Jehovah's Witness.</p>
<p>We're not supposed to celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about that.</p>
<p>I may have a loophole.</p>
<p>What if you were a Jehovah's Witness that was merely pretending to be into Christmas, gathering clues and blending in to take down the holidays from within? You mean like a spy investigating, making it seem like I'm celebrating, when actually I'm infiltrating Santa's operation? - Yoip!</p>
<p># Going deep cover #</p>
<p># Past enemy lines #</p>
<p># Making everybody think I'm on the Christmas side #</p>
<p># Rocking warm sweaters, hanging big-ass lights #</p>
<p># If the fat man can see me, yo it's gotta look right #</p>
<p># I'll watch all the tv specials that I never could #</p>
<p># I'll even cry during the sad ones, like James Bond would #</p>
<p># And when the big night comes, it's time to set the bait #</p>
<p># Cold milk, hot cookies #</p>
<p># Decorative plate #</p>
<p># And he'll come down the chim-in-ey #</p>
<p># And it will be just him and me #</p>
<p># But he won't know we're enemies #</p>
<p># 'Cause I'll play sincere, spring a trap #</p>
<p># Like that, hug him tight, get on his lap #</p>
<p># And tell him he can come back every year #</p>
<p># 'Cause I am Jehovah's most secret witness #</p>
<p># So I might have to dedicate my life to Christmas #</p>
<p># And act just like I love it till the day I die #</p>
<p># A-b-e-d connoisseur of Christmas #</p>
<p># On the spectrum, none of your business #</p>
<p># Talks to fast to comprehend #</p>
<p># Just wanna do right by my friend #</p>
<p># If years were seasons, this December #</p>
<p># Would be the December of our December #</p>
<p># More blueprints than Howard Hughes #</p>
<p># But if they are blue prints, how do we choose? #</p>
<p># We have to be happy to get to the end #</p>
<p># We have to save Christmas to save our friends #</p>
<p># We have to save Christmas to save our friends #</p>
<p># We have to save Christmas to save our friends #</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Rapping? - Yep, wanna join us? - Totally! Wait, you guys never let me rap with you.</p>
<p>Well, we're gonna need all hands on deck if we're gonna go to regionals.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I just need to Study ThoughIn my room.</p>
<p>So have fun! And then, this morning, I could hear them in the bathroom, doing country Western mash-ups.</p>
<p>And they won't stop talking about regionals! Maybe it's nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah, if "nothing" wears a sweater-vest and seems aggressively asexual.</p>
<p>Come on, let's all study for our biology final in our old-- Where's our table? Who's that guy? You guys all see him too, right? - Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, y'all.</p>
<p>Sorry about the rearrangement.</p>
<p>We need this space to rehearse for the pageant.</p>
<p>But we're not doing the pageant.</p>
<p>Look, guys, I hear your negativity, but also, can I counter with this? Who hates glee? Listen to how that sounds.</p>
<p>Glee literally means "glee." </p>
<p>Oh, stop it! Not liking glee club doesn't make us bullies, and implying that is reverse bullying.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Sing about it? All: No! I understand them, but you, Pierce? Your generation invented music! I don't know about "invented." </p>
<p>Perfected, maybe.</p>
<p>Pierce! They're just trying to pander to your demographics' well-documented historical vanity.</p>
<p>Resist! Abed, wasn't Santa Claus himself part of Pierce's peer group? I believe so.</p>
<p>Both: One, two, three, four.</p>
<p># Santa Claus was born in 1945 #</p>
<p># He had a boogie woogie Coca-Cola army jive #</p>
<p># And when the commies gave the polio to Doris Day #</p>
<p># Sa<span class="reference">Doris Day</span>d the Beatles chase McCarthy away #</p>
<p># That baby boomer Santa #</p>
<p># He's never gonna die #</p>
<p># Santa fought at Woodstock and Vietnam #</p>
<p># And smoked a ton of acid and burnt his bra #</p>
<p># And then in 1970, he did more drugs #</p>
<p># And his hair stayed long and he #</p>
<p># Grew a mustache #</p>
<p># Baby boomer Santa #</p>
<p># He's gonna stay ali-i-i-ive #</p>
<p># Santa invented Spielberg and microchips #</p>
<p># Santa invented Coca-Cola and aerobics #</p>
<p># He made the iron curtain and the Gremlins 2 #</p>
<p># Fake butter and AIDS and Twin Peaks! #</p>
<p># Baby boomer Santa #</p>
<p># Thank you for MTV #</p>
<p># Ow! Ow! #</p>
<p># Baby boomer Santa #</p>
<p># Thank you for everything #</p>
<p># You're welcome #</p>
<p># You're welcome for everything #</p>
<p># in the world #</p>
<p># You're welcome #</p>
<p># You're welcome for all that I bring #</p>
<p># To the world #</p>
<p># I'm baby boomer Santa #</p>
<p># I bring the gift of the world #</p>
<p># Baby boomer Santa #</p>
<p># I'm an American pearl #</p>
<p>Pierce is on board.</p>
<p>That's great! For the Christmas queen, I'm hoping we can get Shirley or Annie.</p>
<p>They both have really strong voices and natural vibrato.</p>
<p>There's also Britta.</p>
<p>Britta's adorable! So Shirley or Annie for the Christmas queen.</p>
<p>There's a leaf on Britta's head.</p>
<p>She's playing a tree! And it's gonna be so fun! Mr. Radison, who authorized you to rearrange our study room, and who do you think you are anyway? I'll tell you.</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>I'm scared to go into the study room.</p>
<p>There are so many top hats in there.</p>
<p>I wish there was a way we could stop all this.</p>
<p>I mean, I realize the stakes aren't actually that high, but somehow, that just makes it extra scary.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Jeff, I think I know what Mr. Rad is up to.</p>
<p>There's something you have to see.</p>
<p>Mr. Rad plans to get every single member of our study group to join the glee club.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know how he thinks that's gonna happen.</p>
<p>I'll show you.</p>
<p>Wha--? This is just one of the many costume changes I'll be doing during the show.</p>
<p>We're a shoo-in for regionals, right? Annie, you too? This is beneath you.</p>
<p>You are an intelligent woman.</p>
<p>Also, you're Jewish!</p>
<p>I guess I have a lot to learn about holiday tradition.</p>
<p># Teach me how to understand Christmas #</p>
<p># Show me how to open a box #</p>
<p># It hurts my little head #</p>
<p># When I'm lying in my bed #</p>
<p># With visions of sugarplum socks #</p>
<p>Is this a bit?</p>
<p># Teach me how to understand Christmas #</p>
<p># Do I trim the tree #</p>
<p># Or the deer? #</p>
<p># I can't keep it straight #</p>
<p># And now it's getting late #</p>
<p># Where does the stocking go? #</p>
<p># Here? #</p>
<p># I can't see! #</p>
<p># What's a Christmas Eve? #</p>
<p># is that Santa's lady? #</p>
<p># are snowmen cold or hot? #</p>
<p># won't you be my daddy? #</p>
<p># I'm a silly Christmas baby #</p>
<p># tell me what to deck #</p>
<p># 'Cause I forgot #</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p># "Bwain" hurt-y, understand-y "cwistmas" #</p>
<p># Mistletoe for eat-y, taste good? #</p>
<p># You smarty, me dumb #</p>
<p># Help "pwetty" have fun #</p>
<p># Boopy doopy doop boop #</p>
<p># Sex #</p>
<p>Look, eventually, you hit a point of diminishing returns on the sexiness.</p>
<p>What's a dimin--?</p>
<p>Stay back, old man.</p>
<p>Don't even hum.</p>
<p>Shirley, Britta, I have no intention of singing.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I can't speak for these little angels though.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p># There's a magic in the air #</p>
<p># Around us #</p>
<p># We all have the sudden urge to bake #</p>
<p># It feels like a very special birthday #</p>
<p># But whose name should be written on the cake? #</p>
<p>Mm!</p>
<p>Shirley, you need to get out of here! </p>
<p># We asked our public school to give the answer #</p>
<p># They're not gonna tell you. #</p>
<p># But they could only teach us not to pray #</p>
<p># That's what they do. #</p>
<p>That's what they do.</p>
<p># The constitution says the state can't tell us #</p>
<p># Was anyone important born today? #</p>
<p>Oh, gotta tell the babies! </p>
<p># Jesus Christ! #</p>
<p># Jesus Christ is the lord #</p>
<p># Happy birthday, Jesus #</p>
<p># Happy birthday #</p>
<p># Cut the cake, cut the cake now #</p>
<p># Cut the cake, my lord #</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff, thank God! They got Shirley! It's just you and me now.</p>
<p>Jeff?</p>
<p>Guys, I am swelling with pride! You stepped up, and you saved the Christmas pageant! Whoo! And it's all thanks to you, Mr. Rad.</p>
<p>I just hope we can repay you by making regionals.</p>
<p>Uh, I thought this was regionals.</p>
<p>Don't let my confusion undercut their importance.</p>
<p>Places, everyone!</p>
<p>Scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch.</p>
<p>I could not have done this without your recruiting skills, Abed.</p>
<p>I was happy to do it.</p>
<p>For a while there, I thought we were gonna end the semester on a really dark note.</p>
<p>I'm glad we're singing and dancing together instead.</p>
<p>This has been a good time.</p>
<p>And it's going to continue to be a good time.</p>
<p>If we win regionals, then it's straight on to sectionals.</p>
<p>And then a week later is semis.</p>
<p>Then semiregionals.</p>
<p>Then regional-semis.</p>
<p>Then national lower-zone semis! Oh.</p>
<p>But I kinda thought this was You know, just for Christmas.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>This is forever.</p>
<p>This is what we do now.</p>
<p>This is who we are.</p>
<p># Fa la la la la #</p>
<p># Fa la la la la #</p>
<p># Fa la #</p>
<p># Fa la la la la #</p>
<p># Fa la la la la #</p>
<p>Holla!</p>
<p># We are planet Christmas when we sing #</p>
<p># We will sing together throughout everything #</p>
<p># We are planet Christmas #</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Is this about regionals? I just talked to Cory, and he needs you to be the mouse king instead of me.</p>
<p>Me? But I'm supposed to be a mute tree.</p>
<p>It's an emergency.</p>
<p>Hmm? This will help us get to regionals! I knew it! Wait, what are the lyrics? - They're in your heart, Britta.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Duh doy!</p>
<p># We are everyone, and we are everything #</p>
<p># Christmas time! #</p>
<p>What the--? Oh, Britta's in this?</p>
<p># I got a Christmas time for me #</p>
<p># I got a Christmas time for a tree #</p>
<p>No! She's ruining it!</p>
<p># Christmas #</p>
<p># Christmas time #</p>
<p># Me so Christmas, me so merry #</p>
<p>No, stop, stop, stop, stop! What are you doing? Get off the stage! </p>
<p>I'm singing my heart's song.</p>
<p>Get off the stage, and never sing again! You are the worst! Hey! You do not get to call Britta "the worst." </p>
<p>Yeah! </p>
<p>Let her finish! </p>
<p>Mr. Radison, I think it's fine.</p>
<p>I know Greendale is an all-inclusive school.</p>
<p>Why don't we let Britta sing her awkward song? Yeah!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no! This show is supposed to be gleeful and bright and fun, and you can let me do that, or there can be another bus crash!</p>
<p>Well, figuratively.</p>
<p>I'm not saying, "I killed the last glee club."</p>
<p>I'm saying you not listening to me is like metaphorically cutting the brake lines on your own-- look, Kings of Leon!</p>
<p>What did he say? Did Mr. Rad <span class="reference">Kings</span>the last glee club? And to think I trusted him enough to captain a magic carpet in that dream I had last night.</p>
<p>Maybe Jeff's right.</p>
<p>Maybe forcing things to be bright just makes the darkness underneath even darker.</p>
<p>This was all my fault, insisting we do the pageant.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>I guess I'll just see you guys after the holidays.</p>
<p>Happy time day, Reggie.</p>
<p>It is tradition to give one's constable a gift at the end of each orbital cycle.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you, inspector!</p>
<p>Blimey! A hologram? - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Let's activate it and view the performance.</p>
<p># I tried to find a way around #</p>
<p># Then get behind your wall #</p>
<p># I tried to reach the top #</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p># The angels did say #</p>

<p># In fields where they #</p>
<p># Lay keeping their sheep #</p>
<p># On a cold winter's night #</p>
<p>That was so deep.</p>
<p>We decided we wanted to spend the holiday together.</p>
<p>It's been a dark semester.</p>
<p>I basically killed a guy.</p>
<p>And I kind of attacked you guys with a fire axe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about seeing a new shrink.</p>
<p>What? - Don't.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Look how terrible this Christmas special is.</p>
