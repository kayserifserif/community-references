<p>Best friends, best friends  Making a cake  - Wait.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p># Best friends, best friends #</p>
<p># Making a cake #</p>
<p>Pyoo! I never thought I'd miss it.</p>
<p>How come I'm not best friends with anyone in the group? Aw! Don't patronize me.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p># She'll be coming around the mountain #</p>
<p># When she comes, whoo-whoo #</p>
<p>Just letting the students know that if you're on campus this weekend, you'll have to park on the street because of the carnival.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I'm into trains now.</p>
<p>A real carnival? Is the company called red beard's amusements? Name rings a bell.</p>
<p>But with me, that could mean anything.</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>I have an ex-boyfriend that travels with a carnival.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Britta.</p>
<p>Some things are funny because they make no sense.</p>
<p>And that is not one of them.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like my news has incited some doings.</p>
<p>And if that's not my job, what is? Choo choo! Well, you're also supposed to-- Eh.</p>
<p>Administrate the school.</p>
<p>So, Britta, tell us about your carnival worker boyfriend.</p>
<p>Why, so you all can get a big laugh? - Yeah.</p>
<p>I'd love to have a laugh.</p>
<p>The exact reason.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I'm not ashamed of my past.</p>
<p>And if it entertains you guys, that's great because we're friends.</p>
<p>His name is Blade and -- What?</p>
<p>Oh, no, Britta! She invoked friendship to undercut the laugh, and we're still laughing.</p>
<p>That's how funny it is! His name is Blade.</p>
<p>Is that legal? Shouldn't New Line Cinema be suing him?</p>
<p>He was called that before that stupid movie.</p>
<p>He was called that before the fantastic movie.</p>
<p>And it was a Marvel comic in 1973.</p>
<p>Well, nerd alert.</p>
<p>Well, ex-boyfriend named Blade alert.</p>
<p>Her love life makes Pierce seem with it.</p>
<p>Her pain unifies us.</p>
<p>She has the King Arthur of bad taste in men.</p>
<p>I'm glad you guys are reacting this way.</p>
<p>I need to be reminded that he is the worst on earth.</p>
<p>Because if he comes through town and calls me, I will be there in five minutes.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Uh, Andre much? - Okay, I understand.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>You will.</p>
<p>What's that mean? - He's hung.</p>
<p>Oh, God! Pierce, you're disgusting.</p>
<p>Just like that I'm disgusting again.</p>
<p>I was one of the gang.</p>
<p>It was in my hand.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a woman meets a man that she just can't shake from her system no matter much she knows better.</p>
<p>I lucked out with Andre, but God help me.</p>
<p>As you all know, there's not a lot he couldn't get away with.</p>
<p>So what, Britta? You're in love with a guy who's named after a kickboxing vampire movie? A fantastic kickboxing vampire movie.</p>
<p>No, I don't believe in love because of this guy named after a kickboxing vampire movie.</p>
<p>Oh, Britta! Oh, sweetie.</p>
<p>You wanna watch Blade tonight? Yes.</p>
<p>Ugh, I love that I have a locker now.</p>
<p>All that wasted time going to my car for mid-afternoon wardrobe adjustments.</p>
<p>What do you think, hmm? Stick with what's working? You're gonna change your shirt? Not if it's working.</p>
<p>It's not working.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>I'll have what she's having.</p>
<p>Hey, grow up, lady! - Annie! - His shirt wasn't working! I need your help.</p>
<p>It's Blade's carnival that's coming.</p>
<p>He's working the BB gun duck-shooting gallery.</p>
<p>I guess he finally got the promotion.</p>
<p>And he will call me.</p>
<p>And left unattended, I will end up doing him like a crossword, and I will regret it.</p>
<p>So I need you to take my phone, and don't give it back until Monday! Of course.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>For real? - Pipe it! And I need to stay with you this weekend.</p>
<p>Not just stay with you, I need to be on lockdown.</p>
<p>You were a pillhead, so think of Blade as Adderall.</p>
<p>And handcuff me to the radiator like a mother-flipping carny-banging werewolf.</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>Our apartment has central heating, but I get the idea-- stay strong.</p>
<p>Man, I wonder how many women I've affected this way.</p>
<p>Ha ha! Whoo whoo! All aboard the human being railway! Next stop, spo--</p>
<p>I'll get to the point.</p>
<p>I'd like your student Troy Barnes enrolled in the air conditioning repair program immediately.</p>
<p>Oh, a wonderful opportunity for a young man of Urban race.</p>
<p>Yet try as I might, I'm unable to make him see it that way.</p>
<p>I need you to change his mind.</p>
<p>But if he's not interested, what can I do? Dean, have we forgotten that your school is under the AC repair school's thumb? Uh, we have not.</p>
<p>Then mine is not to tell you how to do what I want done.</p>
<p>Mine is to want and to say my want.</p>
<p>Yours is to know and to do.</p>
<p>I know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>Natalie, could you get me a, um, book on how to do things? You know what, just make me a scotch and soda.</p>
<p>Make it yourself! - I don't know how.</p>
<p>I love Blade's special Blade weapons.</p>
<p>Yeah, see that sword? It has two blades.</p>
<p>One blade is silver, the other blade is infused with garlic.</p>
<p>I should check my messages.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Guys, could we maybe watch a different movie or just stop saying that word six times per minute? - What word? - Blade.</p>
<p>Oh, because of Britta's ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>Can you check my messages for me and tell me if he called? I don't think that's a good idea.</p>
<p>What if my mother died? You guys are really talking over Blade.</p>
<p>Not cool! - Annie, subdue<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Blade</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611'>Blade</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1998&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Sci-Fi</span></span></span></span> guest.</p>
<p>Annie, think for one second.</p>
<p>You have my phone, and you're not even checking it.</p>
<p>What if my mother is dying? This is junkie talk.</p>
<p>You just wanna know where your phone's hidden.</p>
<p>I just wanna know if my mother is dying.</p>
<p>It's a simple yes or no.</p>
<p>I'll cover my eyes.</p>
<p>You go check my phone and say, "No, your mother isn't dying" or "Yes, your mother is dying," and then we go back to watching the film.</p>
<p>Give it to me! That's right, Britta.</p>
<p>It's a banana.</p>
<p>Why is there a banana in your DVD cabinet? Read the banana, Britta.</p>
<p>"You are a lying junkie." </p>
<p>I'm sure those words hurt.</p>
<p>But you wouldn't be reading them if they weren't true.</p>
<p>I am so weak.</p>
<p>But we are not defined by our limitations.</p>
<p>We are defined by our potentials.</p>
<p>I have the potential to watch Blade.</p>
<p>You two are bad friends! Bad.</p>
<p>That's unfair.</p>
<p>What about you guys? Okay, you don't like our movie, we can't say the word "Blade," there's phones in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Troy, Abed! - Let me see if he called! I have a right to know! You're monsters! You're Hitlers! You're racist pedophiles! You're the opposites of Batman! You don't know what that means.</p>
<p>Gonna rip out your throats and eat your-- Still think the lock was overkill? No.</p>
<p>There's phones in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>It's you.</p>
<p>Boys' night!  I need help reacting to something.</p>
<p>Hi! I heard it's just a quick icky play.</p>
<p>You tell anyone we did this, I will stop letting you do things with me I'm afraid to tell anyone about.</p>
<p>Hey, I get it.</p>
<p>You wanna take a look at Britta's ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>If you did it by yourself, you'd be weird.</p>
<p>You're the only one that really understands me.</p>
<p>Oh, funky.</p>
<p>Ha! What, are you guys on a date? Pretty awkward.</p>
<p>Look what Pierce won me.</p>
<p>What is this? I decided to go outside the group for a best friend.</p>
<p>And you couldn't do better than Chang? You take that back! He could do plenty better than me.</p>
<p>I was the first to say yes.</p>
<p>Well, have fun forcing life.</p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p>What do you wanna do next? - Cotton candy? - Russian roulette? - What did you say? - Cotton candy sounds great.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>That's it? Huh.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>He's not as good-looking as you.</p>
<p>I wasn't fishing for that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I offered it freely.</p>
<p>Come on, I wanna go on a ride.</p>
<p>This is a window for me.</p>
<p>I spent my carnival years pregnant.</p>
<p>Shirley, I'm not jealous.</p>
<p>I just wanted to see what the deal was.</p>
<p>Obviously the deal is he's a dirtball, Britta hates herself, voila.</p>
<p>What do you wanna do? I'd like to go on a ride.</p>
<p>Let's go shoot some ducks.</p>
<p>Jeffrey! Eight of clubs.</p>
<p>I win.</p>
<p>Nice! - How are you feeling? - Good.</p>
<p>Great, actually.</p>
<p>Thank you, Annie.</p>
<p>I could've never done this without you.</p>
<p>I'm glad to be able to help you.</p>
<p>I want you to know-- and I've never said these words-- but I've always felt them.</p>
<p>You're a sister to me.</p>
<p>Britta! Whoo! Hey, little sis, do you think you could trust me to have my phone back now? I've got my email on there, my calendar, homework assignments.</p>
<p>I'm kinda screwed without it.</p>
<p>You're not just manipulating me, right? Oh, because of, oh jeez.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>That's over, Annie.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Okay, I have it right here.</p>
<p>It's a gateway to further trust.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Love the gateway.</p>
<p>Honoring the gateway.</p>
<p>I have to call my doctor for some results.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm fine.</p>
<p>It's just a little personal.</p>
<p>You need privacy, sure thing.</p>
<p>I'll check on you later.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Thank you, sweetie.</p>
<p>Boy, this guy doesn't give vampires a square inch of leeway.</p>
<p>He's harsh.</p>
<p>What's wrong, Annie? You came out of the bedroom smiling, and then your smile faded as you leaned against the door.</p>
<p>I gave Britta her phone.</p>
<p>You did? Why? She needs to feel trust to recover, or she'll relapse.</p>
<p>She's gonna relapse because you gave her her phone.</p>
<p>No, I secretly switched Blade's number in her phone to my number<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Blade</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611'>Blade</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1998&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Sci-Fi</span></span></span></span>if she tries to get in touch with him, - it'll come to me.</p>
<p>That's diabolical.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're just like Blade, man.</p>
<p>Straight up.</p>
<p>I just hope she c<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Blade</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611'>Blade</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1998&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Sci-Fi</span></span></span></span>nd the strength to-- She's probably just telling him she's dying to feel the warmth of his Are you kidding me? She said we were sisters.</p>
<p>I am so sad right now.</p>
<p>And she is so codependent! And such a bad speller.</p>
<p>Nice shootin'.</p>
<p>Tough luck.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I'll go another round.</p>
<p>There's room in our bed for three bears, right, honey? And then some, sugar.</p>
<p>You're very nice For a man named What'd you say it was? Blade? Yup.</p>
<p>But that's a carnival name though, right? A nom de corn dog? Why would I have a carnival name? Your parents named you Blade? Apparently.</p>
<p>Well, you seem okay with it.</p>
<p>Not much to do about it.</p>
<p>You could change it.</p>
<p>To what? Templeton Ferrari III? Won't change how mustard tastes.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Won't change how mustard tastes.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I see the appeal.</p>
<p>He's relaxed, he's cool.</p>
<p>N-not as cool as you.</p>
<p>Mr. Blade.</p>
<p>I want three more rounds.</p>
<p>Jeffrey! <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Blade</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611'>Blade</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1998&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Sci-Fi</span></span></span></span>onna change the way mustard tastes.</p>
<p>Oh, and you're so cool, Shirley.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am.</p>
<p>How many times are they gonna do that? Aw, this is it, isn't it? We're becoming best friends.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p># Would you let me be your best friend #</p>
<p># I would call you every day #</p>
<p>Oh, my God! One after the other!</p>
<p>"I'm texting to tell you I'm not texting you any more."</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.</p>
<p>"Are you mad at me now? Fine. I guess you don't wanna know our two-year-old." </p>
<p>Can we please just put it under a stack of mattresses or something? I don't know.</p>
<p>When is she gonna take a hint? Britta's attracted to unavailable men.</p>
<p>Dean, why are you here? - Ouch.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Let's make him available.</p>
<p>What are you doing? - Ending this.</p>
<p>"Leave me alone." </p>
<p>No! That's so much worse.</p>
<p>See? She stopped.</p>
<p>She's calling him? She was born in the '80s.</p>
<p>She still uses her phone as a phone.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>That's fine, it's fine.</p>
<p>We just won't answer it.</p>
<p>Won't it go to your voicemail? Hello? Blade? There you go.</p>
<p>I don't know! Change your settings so it doesn't go to voicemail.</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>You guys act like a carnival.</p>
<p>Be a carnival.</p>
<p>Now! - Step right up! - Ding, ding, ding! Get your popcorn here.</p>
<p>Hello? - Busy, babe.</p>
<p>Blade, just wait.</p>
<p>Wait, Blade, I told you not to call me at work! </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I forgot. Don't be mad at me." </p>
<p>She's whipped by an imaginary douche.</p>
<p>Hey, don't knock it till you try it.</p>
<p>I got my fake bachelor's degree, and then I cheated on the LSAT.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering, how do you cheat on the LSAT? How? A magician never reveals his secrets, my friend.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Yeah! In your face! - Good job.</p>
<p>Uh, give me the big one! Yeah, that's the one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not too shabby, huh? Yeah, you really did it, baby.</p>
<p>So you dropped out of high school and joined the carnival.</p>
<p>And 15 years later, here you are.</p>
<p>Jeffrey! - Guess that's about it.</p>
<p>So what's the record? What's the best anyone's ever done in this booth? - I guess eight ducks.</p>
<p>All right, one more round.</p>
<p>One more round.</p>
<p>Jeff? - Honey? Will you excuse us just for a moment, please? Certainly.</p>
<p>Can you get over here? - What is your end game here? - I don't know.</p>
<p>I wanna know.</p>
<p>Wanna know what? I wanna know what drove Britta crazy about him.</p>
<p>Are you jealous? Are you in love with Britta? No, I am not in love with Britta.</p>
<p>And yes, I'm insanely jealous of him.</p>
<p>What's his secret? Why do you wanna know the secret to making a woman psycho? Why do we wanna know how to blow up the earth or grow a human ear on a mouse? In case we have to, Shirley.</p>
<p>In case we have to.</p>
<p>I'm going to find Pierce.</p>
<p>Good! One of those bears is mine! So this is best friendship.</p>
<p>Something else, isn't it? How do we keep it going? How do we know we won't get into a fight? I say we just let it happen.</p>
<p>Don't tell me what to do! - What's your problem? - What's yours? I'm outta here!</p>
<p># This is the last time #</p>
<p># This is the last time I'll see you smile #</p>
<p># Good-bye #</p>
<p># My friend #</p>
<p># I'll miss you every night #</p>
<p># Good-bye #</p>
<p>Blade, 'sup? Message.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We can stop worrying about voicemail now.</p>
<p>Back to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>Now what are you doing? - Dean, why are you here? - Yikes.</p>
<p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>I know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna be really, really, really mean to her.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>What don't you get about the concept? Britta likes guys who are mean to her.</p>
<p>She doesn't like herself.</p>
<p>Give me the phone.</p>
<p>What did you say? Something nice.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I'm deleting it from your phone.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What's up? You guys still watching movies? Hi, Dean.</p>
<p>Why are you here? Hi, Britta.</p>
<p>And ouch.</p>
<p>And you don't know anything about carpentry.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Or aquariums-- freshwater or saltwater.</p>
<p>Do you have a big weiner? - Nope.</p>
<p>I don't get it, Blade! What's your secret? Why do I wanna impress you? Are you dumb or smart? Are you a loser or winner? Or are you just a human mirror? Do we all see what we wanna see in you? A magician never reveals, right? Right.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You dropped over 300 bucks on my booth, so I'll tell ya.</p>
<p>You wanna know my secret? Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>What are you doing? I wanna know.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I was texting with Blade, but it's over now.</p>
<p>He's a loser.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, uh, Troy! You should really join the air conditioning repair program.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, that didn't work.</p>
<p>That's what I get for improvising.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>So I don't get it.</p>
<p>He's a vampire, but he can walk around during the day? - What is wrong with you? - Huh? You weren't texting Blade, you were texting us.</p>
<p>I switched Blade's number in your phone to mine.</p>
<p>You tricked me? - You tricked me! You ask for my help, you tell me I'm your sister, I do everything I can to make you hate this turd, and the first nice thing he says, and you're over him? Who are you? And why didn't it stick? I was texting with you guys this whole time? So Blade isn't a loser! Uh-oh.</p>
<p>No, let her go.</p>
<p>Lost cause, man.</p>
<p>Jeff! What are you doing here? I just got back from the carnival Where I met Blade.</p>
<p>Is he okay? How is he? He's brain damaged.</p>
<p>Well, let's not be petty.</p>
<p>No, I'm serious.</p>
<p>He showed me the scar.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, before he even met you, a loose bolt flew off a Ferris wheel and embedded in his skull, destroying the part of his brain that feels shame.</p>
<p>He's basically irresistible to people for the same reason he can pretty much only work at a carnival.</p>
<p>He has nothing to prove or disprove about himself or to himself.</p>
<p>He has no shame.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't he have told me that? Because he didn't care if you knew.</p>
<p>That is so like him.</p>
<p>I have to go to him.</p>
<p>No, woman.</p>
<p>None of us have to "go to" anyone.</p>
<p>And the idea we do is a mental illness we contracted from breath mint commercials and <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Sandra Bullock</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113'>Sandra Bullock</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212346'>tt0212346</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1041829'>tt1041829</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468'>tt1454468</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257'>tt0111257</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>We can't keep going to each other until we learn to go to ourselves.</p>
<p>Stop making our hatred of ourselves someone else's job and just stop hating ourselves.</p>
<p>Annie, I want you to take my phone.</p>
<p>Do not let me call Chang.</p>
<p>I'm locking myself in your room.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing out here? Self-actualizing.</p>
<p>Well, it's loud.</p>
<p>Come watch Blade.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This movie is fantastic.</p>
<p>Y'all ever notice that cold spot in the hallway? Oh, yeah! That thing is freezing! You know what could learn a lesson from that cold spot? The air conditioning unit in my living room.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, so yesterday, typical Sunday.</p>
<p>I was hanging out in my Dreamatorium.</p>
<p>Whoo! This ever happen to you guys? I couldn't remember where I imagined the door.</p>
<p>Then I realized I was in an actual bathroom.</p>
<p>Uh, no offense, but this material seems pretty specific to your apartment.</p>
<p>I don't think it'll work at an open mic.</p>
<p>Y'all ever notice the difference between me and Troy brushing our teeth? I brush my teeth like this.</p>
<p>Troy brushes his teeth like this.</p>
<p>I do! I do! I brush my teeth just like that.</p>
<p>Now you know what I'm gonna talk about next.</p>
<p>Toaster oven! It's from his album.</p>
