<p>Raisins don't belong in a chocolate chip cookie.</p>
<p>It gives them depth.</p>
<p>Hey, watch it, punk.</p>
<p>What are you, 80? He's trying to bring back disco.</p>
<p>I don't have to be old to know it's not gonna happen.</p>
<p>What it is, soul brother.</p>
<p>My boys are gonna make me breakfast in bed for Mother's Day.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make breakfast and get in bed, but they're gonna bring it to me.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>They said the cutest thing last night.</p>
<p>They said, "Mama," they call me Mama You're gonna be the fun police.</p>
<p>If I'm the fun police, then you're director of Funland Security.</p>
<p>Good, more of this.</p>
<p>More of what? What do you think? The constant bickering.</p>
<p>It was cute at first, but, well, Abed explains it best.</p>

<p>Your sexual tension, lack of chemistry are putting us on edge, ironically, on every level, you're keeping us from being friends.</p>
<p>Jeff and I do not have sexual tension.</p>
<p>We just argue all the time.</p>
<p>Oh, just like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Sam and Diane</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399'>Cheers</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1982&ndash;1993</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span></span></span></span>.</p>

Okay, we get it.</p>
<p>You're young.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>See what you're doing to us? Want my advice? Pork her and move on.</p>
<p>We did it all the time in my day.</p>
<p>Yeah, you also put hydrogen in blimps, that was bad.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Just a reminder.</p>
<p>Our Spring Fling is on the quad today.</p>
<p>Music, food, activities.</p>
<p>What, what? He makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Still in the room.</p>
<p>There's also going to be a game of Paintball Assassin with a prize for last man standing.</p>
<p>Or last man in a wheelchair with no paint.</p>
<p>Or last woman.</p>
<p>Give it a rest, Britta.</p>
<p>What's the prize? It was a Blu-ray DVD player, but it was stolen.</p>
<p>So now it's TBD.</p>
<p>I want TBD.</p>
<p>Is that new? If it's what I think, I had it in the '70s.</p>
<p>Let's get back to Britta and Jeff.</p>
<p>There's no Britta and Jeff.</p>
<p>He said, fully erect.</p>
<p>I'm gonna let you guys figure this out while I go take a nap in my car.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? What the hell? Hello? What is going on? The paintball game was starting, and the dean The dean announced the prize.</p>
<p>The prize.</p>
<p>We turned on each other like animals.</p>
<p>What was the prize? Was? This is not over.</p>
<p>This is still happening right now.</p>
<p>Leonard? Leonard, I'm not playing.</p>
<p>Everyone's playing.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>You suck.</p>
<p>Come with me if you don't want paint on your clothes.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Look what I found wandering the neutral zone.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I thought you were dead, man.</p>
<p>I was just taking a nap.</p>
<p>Has everyone lost their mind? It's just a game of paintball.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With one rule.</p>
<p>Last man standing gets the prize.</p>
<p>The prize.</p>
<p>The prize.</p>
<p>What is this prize? You don't know.</p>
<p>Priority registration.</p>
<p>Priority registration? That's why everyone's running around like a bunch Does that mean what I think? Like you could have first choice of your classes next semester? Easy, sugar bear.</p>
<p>But you could schedule all your classes on a Monday and take a six-day weekend.</p>
<p>You could do a lot of things.</p>
<p>Talk him through the hunger.</p>
<p>Every student wants that prize, Jeff.</p>
<p>No way to share it, so we'll all turn on each other.</p>
<p>But the longer we wait to do that Jeff.</p>
<p>The longer we work together, the longer we last.</p>
<p>Everyone running in packs? Debate team was first, they fell to infighting.</p>
<p>The glee club is luring stragglers into sniper traps with cheery renditions of songs.</p>
<p>Really? And people fall for that? Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm all for winning, but let's not resort to cheap ploys.</p>
<p>Are the girls in the game? Britta? No, I don't mean Britta.</p>
<p>Did I say Britta? Twice now.</p>
<p>Chess Club.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>He's a pawn.</p>
<p>Checkmate, bitches.</p>
<p>And tell the drama club their tears will be real today.</p>
<p>No, that's all sugar, man.</p>
<p>Get some protein.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Peanuts.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Peanuts, peanuts.</p>
<p>No, take the stuff out closer to you.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>The ones in the back are the freshest.</p>
<p>That will keep us going.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What the hell? I got you covered, bro.</p>
<p>You guys formed an alliance without me? Yeah.</p>
<p>You with Star-Burns? Not if I can be with you.</p>
<p>It's just Star-Burns.</p>
<p>Anyone else need a pee break? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I'll stand guard.</p>
<p>I don't need to pee.</p>
<p>I'm wearing a diaper for the game.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>For the game.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, make this quick before Pierce's chewing attracts enemies.</p>
<p>Um, guys? Hold it.</p>
<p>Don't move.</p>
<p>Drop it.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, be cool.</p>
<p>We can beat the others if we merge.</p>
<p>We're doing fine.</p>
<p>You win the game camped on a crapper? Worked on you.</p>
<p>Did it? You have a gun in your face? Matches yours.</p>
<p>Nice comeback.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the agreement is we're allies until we're sure we're the last seven standing.</p>
<p>You thinking what I'm thinking? Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Our team's walking with God.</p>
<p>I'm thinking we might already be the only seven left, in which case, this is a window for the two of us to take out the others.</p>
<p>Real nice, Troy, that'd be great PR for the black students.</p>
<p>I am not an ambassador.</p>
<p>I am gladiator.</p>
<p>Now, you want to win or not? Oh! Troy made God mad.</p>
<p>Take cover.</p>
<p>Run, Pierce.</p>
<p>Glee club.</p>
<p>How do you know it's the glee club? Listen.</p>
<p># Hit me with your best shot #</p>
<p>Oh, brother.</p>
<p>That is so uninspired.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>I got a plan.</p>
<p>Get ready.</p>
<p>Hey, Pierce.</p>
<p>Don't come over here, okay? Screw you.</p>
<p>I'm coming over there.</p>
<p>Medic.</p>
<p>In the trees.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Write some original songs.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do if you win priority registration? I'll make my schedule airtight.</p>
<p>Maybe get out of here in 3 years instead of 4.</p>
<p>I'd take any class with no tests and no papers.</p>
<p>What would you do, Shirley? I'd choose all morning classes so I could get home early to spend some time with my boys.</p>
<p>It's hard being away from them so much.</p>
<p>You know what? I say if any of us win, we give it to Shirley as a Mother's Day gift.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What? Abed, you don't have to do that.</p>
<p>I am so sick of you guilting people with your phony humanitarian shtick.</p>
<p>Phony? When I win, you can watch me do it.</p>
<p>Of course, but that won't make it less phony.</p>
<p>You'd be a lot more likeable If I never did anything for anybody? Yeah.</p>
<p>Because when you help people, that always turns out great.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Study group.</p>
<p>Come out and play.</p>
<p>Oh, look, it's post-ironic Disco Stu.</p>
<p>You still trying to bring it back? Hi.</p>
<p>Damn, he brought it back.</p>
<p>Put your hands in the air.</p>
<p>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.</p>
<p>They shot us.</p>
<p>It's hot, it's hot.</p>
<p>Let's go, fool.</p>
<p>The last guy almost got me.</p>
<p>My legs.</p>
<p>Oh, Shirley, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>I'm going home, Britta.</p>
<p>I know, Shirley, I know.</p>
<p>No, seriously, I'm going home.</p>
<p>Can you help me up? Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Shirley, I'm gonna win for you and your boys.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Shirley, I'm gonna win that prize, but not for you and your boys.</p>
<p>That's less nice.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you've been hit.</p>
<p>What? Oh, no.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>It's blood.</p>
<p>I thought it was paint, but I'm just bleeding.</p>
<p>Talk about luck.</p>
<p>I can't believe this game is still going on.</p>
<p>It's 2 a.m.</p>
<p>What if someone gets hurt and the police come? They'll think I'm a bad dean.</p>
<p>There's classes in the morning.</p>
<p>This has to stop.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Put me in the game, because I'll take everyone out.</p>
<p>I play paintball three times a week, bro.</p>
<p>I'm one of the douches who brings his own equipment.</p>
<p>But it wouldn't be fair.</p>
<p>You're not a student.</p>
<p>But you can change that, can't you? Huh? Enroll me in a class.</p>
<p>What are your interests? Arts and crafts.</p>
<p>Oh, I do watercolors.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>The group would be thrilled.</p>
<p>The wounded soldier fantasy means we're moments from doing it, right? Yeah, can you feel that tension? It's a miracle we still have clothes on.</p>
<p>You're right, you know.</p>
<p>I am a phony.</p>
<p>I try to act compassionate, because I'm afraid that I'm not.</p>
<p>Oh, please, I invented phony.</p>
<p>You care about people.</p>
<p>I accuse you of faking to convince myself I'm not such a jerk.</p>
<p>Jeff, you help people more than I do, and you don't even want to.</p>
<p>You're not a jerk.</p>
<p>You're fine.</p>
<p>Especially now that I've repaired your overworked torso with my trembling feminine fingers.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Too much sexual tension.</p>
<p>Damn bursting.</p>
<p>It would totally serve them right if we did it here in the study room.</p>
<p>God, could you imagine? I can't stop imagining.</p>
<p>Neither can I.</p>
<p>We should get dressed before the third-shift librarian shows up.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don't want this to turn into a letter to Penthouse, right? I think the group is right.</p>
<p>We did need to relieve some tension.</p>
<p>Tell me you didn't have sex with me to win at paintball.</p>
<p>No, I had sex with you, and I'm gonna win at paintball.</p>
<p>Don't be gross.</p>
<p>I'm gross? You seem pretty practiced at putting on panties one-handed while holding a gun.</p>
<p>Can I get dressed before you assassinate me? So all that happened, it meant nothing to you? I didn't say that.</p>
<p>What did it mean to you? I asked you first.</p>
<p>Very mature.</p>
<p>Said the woman wearing Hello Kitty.</p>
<p>Said the woman holding the gun.</p>
<p>You sure that's a gun? Because maybe it's a metaphor for your fake, jaded persona.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>No paintballs, Hans? What do you think, I'm stupid? When'd you take it? When you started seducing.</p>
<p>I wasn't though.</p>
<p>Assuming that makes you way grosser.</p>
<p>Not when I'm right.</p>
<p>Buenos dias, children.</p>
<p>You'll be happy to know you made it till the end.</p>
<p>You're not even a student.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Critical Media Literacy and Politics of Gender, biatch.</p>
<p>Give me your clip.</p>
<p>Oh, that would be brilliant of me.</p>
<p>Look, you got the drop on me.</p>
<p>I lost.</p>
<p>Let me do this for you.</p>
<p>Be pretty crazy if I shot you right now, huh? What's so funny, Chang? Maybe it's the fact there's no such thing as priority registration.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's this.</p>
<p>Ta-da.</p>
<p>Dean.</p>
<p>Just one moment.</p>
<p>Oh, hi there, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>That's a good look for you.</p>
<p>Everybody out there is shooting each other for nothing while you sit here in your ivory tower.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I can explain.</p>
<p>I messed up when I promised priority registration.</p>
<p>It's a violation of some student equality act, but this isn't.</p>
<p>Ta-da! Okay, now, it's not Blu-ray, but it comes with its own remote, so Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You get it all out of your system? Almost.</p>
<p>What do you want from me, Jeffrey? Guess.</p>
<p>Oh, hi.</p>
<p>Hey, how's it going? You still have some paint.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Um, I was thinking You don't have to.</p>
<p>It didn't happen.</p>
<p>It's not a mistake.</p>
<p>It didn't happen.</p>
<p>It was a crazy night of paintball.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Tension relieving.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>No need to mention it to anyone.</p>
<p>Right, no big deal.</p>
<p>Nothing's changed.</p>
<p>Something's changed.</p>
<p>Oh, Abed.</p>
<p>Crazy Abed.</p>
<p>No, something's different now.</p>
<p>Could be me.</p>
<p>Sporting a man-thong.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's that I have emerged victorious with a priority registration form.</p>
<p>Well done, Jeff.</p>
<p>And in recognition of her bravery, not to mention her children, I hereby award this to the best soldier, Shirley.</p>
<p>Now, the bad news is, for legal purposes, next semester, if anybody asks, you have gout.</p>
<p>Do you mind walking with a limp? Mm.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Look, Annie.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn't see that coming.</p>
<p>Neither did I.</p>
<p>So no one feels it? No one senses anything's different? Nope.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>It's riding up a little.</p>
