<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Nice day out today, isn't it? Yeah, shoot.</p>
<p>You forget something? Yeah, I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with Shirley's.</p>
<p>We both have a class across campus and I can't go that kind of distance with "Oh, that's nice."</p>
<p>That's mean.</p>
<p>No, that's not nice.</p>
<p>I find Shirley very easy to talk to.</p>
<p>Besides, aren't you supposed to have like an Olympic gold medal in jibber jabber? Yeah, but I'm a sprinter.</p>
<p>I'm at my best during high speed bursts of wit.</p>
<p>On a Shirley walk, I'd be winded by that stoner tree.</p>
<p>Hey, Britta.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What's up? Hey, Vaughn, how's it going? No worries.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Because I might be worried if I was playing hacky sack a decade too late.</p>
<p>My class is that way.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that we easily walked more than a hundred yards with no awkward pauses.</p>
<p>And that is the sign of a true friend.</p>
<p>So I'm really glad you're not hitting on me anymore.</p>
<p>There's the awkward pause.</p>
<p>Aah! Excuse me.</p>
<p>Oh, pardon me.</p>
<p>Professor Duncan.</p>
<p>Professor Duncan.</p>
<p>Uh, ooh, sorry.</p>
<p>Annie Edison, I'm in your 101 lecture.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I've heard about your special psych lab.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>The Duncan Principle.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I know it's limited to second year students, but I had a 4.0 at Riverside High.</p>
<p>And I'm not looking down on this school at all.</p>
<p>But I'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills that I was told would help me focus but they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you will let me take your lab early, it would be a real feather in my transcript.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I've actually been in this situation many times, so I'm just gonna be upfront.</p>
<p>I'm not allowed to date students.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But if in spite of that you are still interested, then you may join the lab.</p>
<p>Oh! Ah.</p>
<p>Okay, you need to bring two human subjects.</p>
<p>I asked politely and the panda took his pants off.</p>
<p>I never even knew that's what asexual meant.</p>
<p>I wonder what this express package could be.</p>
<p>Somebody had to get something to me very fast.</p>
<p>You brought your mail to campus.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>My Ear-Noculars.</p>
<p>What is that? It looks like your blue-tooth thingy.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>This is my cell phone headset.</p>
<p>And this is Ear-Noculars.</p>
<p>It's for spies and what-not.</p>
<p>Gives you sonic hearing.</p>
<p>All hearing is sonic.</p>
<p>What's that? So who wants to be in a psych experiment? Hey, guys, guys.</p>
<p>Annie is talking about some kind of experiment.</p>
<p>She's behind you.</p>
<p>Not interested.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>You get paid.</p>
<p>Do they do stuff to your butt? No.</p>
<p>Do you get paid more if they do stuff to your butt? No.</p>
<p>It's fine, I'll do it, I'm in.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>How about you, Abed? It's tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, they're showing all four "<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Indiana Jones</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971'>Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1981&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span></span></span></span>"es at The Vista.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to the first three.</p>
<p>I bought a whip.</p>
<p>This is really important to me, Abed.</p>
<p>Could you please go as my friend? My really good friend? Well, I didn't realize we were really good friends.</p>
<p>I figured we were really more like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Chandler and Phoebe</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778'>Friends</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1994&ndash;2004</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Romance</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<p>Oh, thank you, Abed.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go save Britta from that dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, she looks like she's in trouble.</p>
<p>Hope he doesn't try to handsome her to death.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What's up, man? Hi, I'm Vaughn.</p>
<p>You in line? Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>We're just, uh, we're just chilling.</p>
<p>Hey, you're not gonna order coffee? Oh, no, I was just seeing if Britta--</p>
<p>No judgment, bro.</p>
<p>I used to do coffee.</p>
<p>Then I made the switch to green tea, it's like filled with these antioxidants and stuff.</p>
<p>It's pretty tight.</p>
<p>Tight.</p>
<p>Yes, I've heard that about green tea.</p>
<p>I like green tea.</p>
<p>I should make the change.</p>
<p>Up top, sugar bear.</p>
<p>Yeah, give me some of that.</p>
<p>Small coffee, please.</p>
<p>Britta's making the change to green tea.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>It'll be a scandal.</p>
<p>Welcome, research assistants.</p>
<p>Turn your attention to the monitor, you will see that our subjects are waiting for the experiment to begin.</p>
<p>But it's actually happening right now.</p>
<p>You see, the waiting is the experiment.</p>
<p>The Duncan Principle is simple.</p>
<p>Namely, the more control lost by--</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm gonna write this down too, actually.</p>
<p>That's a good point.</p>
<p>The more control lost by the ego, the more gained by the id.</p>
<p>Resulting in a surprisingly predictable, emotional eruption or breaking point.</p>
<p>Known to Ma and Pa as a good old-fashioned tantrum.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects that we're gonna be starting the experiment in five minutes, okay? And, Annie, it's never actually going to start.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>I like that, all day.</p>
<p>Hi, everyone.</p>
<p>Hi, Troy.</p>
<p>Hi, Abed.</p>
<p>Hi, Senor Chang.</p>
<p>What, community college Spanish teacher can't use 80 bucks? Well, we're just running a little bit behind, so we'll probably start in five minutes.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Unacceptable.</p>
<p>When you say something starts at 9, it starts at nueve.</p>
<p>Ah! No, no.</p>
<p>And we're off.</p>
<p>Did you know we walk the same way after class? I'm sure you didn't or else we would've been walking together, unless you're a jerk, hmm, just kidding.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Don't go too fast for these dogs.</p>
<p>Short legs.</p>
<p>Do you like Green---?</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>You got a kid, right?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>So Pierce isn't exactly right in the head, is he? I know a lot of grown men with radar dishes coming out of their ears.</p>
<p>He's like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Inspector Gadget</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141369'>Inspector Gadget</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1999&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Yeah, go go gadget incontinence.</p>
<p>How about that guy that's always around flirting with Britta? I know.</p>
<p>He's the worst, Vaughn? I know.</p>
<p>What is with his hair? It's perpetually moist.</p>
<p>Okay, we're three hours in, let's review what we've seen.</p>
<p>And pay close attention to every subject's breaking point.</p>
<p>We've got a shouter.</p>
<p>That one's a stomper.</p>
<p>Bye, hippie.</p>
<p>There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down like a 6-foot child.</p>
<p>Shaking, write that down.</p>
<p>Visible shakes.</p>
<p>Look at the little one chase the big one, look at them go.</p>
<p>I can make them go quicker, it's like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Benny Hill</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063869'>The Benny Hill Show</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1969&ndash;1989</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Get them.</p>
<p>Lightens the mood.</p>
<p>And back to the present.</p>
<p>And then there were two.</p>
<p>Break, break.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>What is going on in there? I wasted all day here for you.</p>

<p>You promised--</p>
<p>And he's out.</p>
<p>We got him.</p>
<p>Professor, what is with that last guy? I've seen this before.</p>
<p>The longer they wait, the harder they break.</p>
<p>Buckle up, students.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>See how often Hacky Sack takes his shirt off? He'd play shirts and skins in a game of checkers.</p>
<p>I'm so glad to be able to talk to someone about this.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something to Britta about it.</p>
<p>But we're supposed to be friends now, she'd think I was jealous.</p>
<p>I don't see why you and Britta aren't together.</p>
<p>Two white people going to school together, just seems right.</p>
<p>Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, dear.</p>
<p>That is not what I want to see.</p>
<p>And there goes the shirt.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm fine.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Want me to, uh, check you for grass stains? I wasn't sure how or when to bring up that I was hanging out with Vaughn.</p>
<p>I figured that you'd make fun of him and me.</p>
<p>Oh, well, uh, first of all, friends don't make fun of each other, even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie.</p>
<p>And secondly, Vaughn seems cool.</p>
<p>You guys should hang out sometime.</p>
<p>I gotta go.</p>
<p>I, uh, that was tacky out there, you won't ever see that again.</p>
<p>Oh, no worries, brah.</p>
<p>Shirley.</p>
<p>Did you see Senor Chang's socks today? Tiny bullfighters.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>I can top that, did you see that Hacky Sack wears an anklet? Since when won't you talk about Vaughn? I'm trying to be a good friend to Britta.</p>
<p>She thought I was gonna make fun of him, but I want to be unpredictable.</p>
<p>I'm going to show her that I'm not the jerk she thinks I am.</p>
<p>And friend the hell out of that green-tea-drinking drum circler.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But tell me you noticed how small his nipples are.</p>
<p>Not engaging.</p>
<p>What? It's not gossip when it's fact.</p>
<p>My kids got hamsters with big nips.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is, is it on pause? No, that's just him.</p>
<p>Sorry you've been waiting 26 hours.</p>
<p>It's just going to be another five minutes.</p>
<p>Okey-dokey.</p>
<p>Okey-dokey.</p>
<p>Oh, my--why won't he leave?</p>

<p>What? I'm sorry, this guy's not moving.</p>

<p>I should never have let you into this lab, Miss Annie Fanny Panties in a Bunch.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so hilarious.</p>
<p>Did you think of that the last time you skipped a trip to the dentist? Oh.</p>
<p>Let me answer that question with another question.</p>
<p>It's not fair.</p>
<p>It's not fair.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Stop writing.</p>
<p>Put your--give me that.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Get out, you bunch of dorks.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>You have destroyed the Duncan Principle.</p>
<p>Go home.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>So, uh, Britta said that you did a lot of community service.</p>
<p>Ultimate Frisbee at the Senior's Center.</p>
<p>It is amazing.</p>
<p>And what makes Frisbee ultimate? Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>If I had a nickel for every time I wished somebody asked me that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get dessert.</p>
<p>Want anything? Carrots.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm good.</p>
<p>Hey, you two.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Well, that's a cool shirt.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Where's it from? Oh.</p>
<p>Uh, psh, I don't even know.</p>
<p>I guess it's, well, uh, hey, look at that.</p>
<p>Hanes Classic.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>You know, people underestimate the elderly, but you see these guys out there and they're throwing the 'bee, and they're just loving life.</p>
<p>It's just inspiring.</p>
<p>You know, I'm gonna really I'm gonna think about it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm gonna check on Brits.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>You're the devil.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Plus, okay.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>"Where do we go on Saturdays?" You said, "Sunday." I have a question for you.</p>
<p>You like Vaughn, right.</p>
<p>Oh, he, he's very cute.</p>
<p>I'm just worried that he's thinking a little bit more intensely about this thing than I am.</p>
<p>He says stuff, you know, after…</p>
<p>School?</p>
<p>After…</p>
<p>Dinner mints?</p>
<p>After…</p>
<p>Not having sex.</p>
<p>How was that? What? Forget that.</p>
<p>The problem right now is that he's calling me "babe." He's trying to hold my hands.</p>
<p>It's getting a little relationship-y.</p>
<p>And he gave me something.</p>
<p>Herpes? No.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>A poem? How do I respond to something like that? "Thank you?" Well, it's a very good question.</p>
<p>And it's one I will answer--</p>
<p>Uh oh, I'm getting a text.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna read it if you don't mind.</p>
<p>I am reading it and it is read.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice where the ocean meets the sky? Did ya? It's the same wizard blue; that I see in your eye, Britta.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This has brightened my day.</p>
<p>I'm so glad we can rip on that dude again.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>That is the stain of a tear drop over the word, "rad."</p>
<p>Oh, he said rad.</p>
<p>I thought he said red.</p>
<p>That makes it worse.</p>
<p>Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>I'm surprised he can read.</p>
<p>You know? I know.</p>
<p>Hey, sorry about bailing on the psych experiment.</p>
<p>That was the experiment, Troy.</p>
<p>We were testing to see how long people would wait in the room.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>"Gotcha?" That's all you have to say? Yeah.</p>
<p>You sat in a room for 26 straight hours.</p>
<p>Didn't that bother you? Yeah, I was livid.</p>
<p>Then why didn't you leave? Because you asked me to stay and you said we were friends.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Is this still part of experiment? He's more like a puppy with a fish mouth.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>It's more like this: That's right.</p>
<p>Laugh it up.</p>
<p>Wanna know what they're doing? Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Making fun of all of us.</p>
<p>I heard you with my own Ear-Noculars.</p>
<p>Pierce, we are not making fun of you.</p>
<p>Ah, ha-ha.</p>
<p>Calling me Hacky Sack, and ripping my six pack abs and my moist hair.</p>
<p>And that face you made: That was pretty obviously Annie.</p>
<p>Okay, this is definitely still part of the experiment.</p>
<p>Pierce, we were not making fun of you.</p>
<p>We're making fun of Britta's boyfriend, Vaughn.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team.</p>
<p>I'll get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Maybe he has a tiny penis.</p>
<p>Who is this guy? You all have to got to see him.</p>
<p>Everything's all, "No worries, no worries."</p>
<p>He always says hello three times in a row.</p>
<p>"Hello, good evening, how are you?" And look, he wrote a poem.</p>
<p>Can I read it? We shouldn't show that.</p>
<p>No, no, it's fine.</p>
<p>So I'll be done in like an hour? Yeah, no worries.</p>
<p>He just said it.</p>
<p>Guys, you've met Vaughn, right? Hey, what's up? Hi.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>What a fool.</p>
<p>This group's got a case of the giggles, huh? Heh.</p>
<p>Wait, is that? Did you give them my poem? No.</p>
<p>Okay, well, why's the dinosaur rocking a picture of my poem? Here, read it.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>You guys are--you guys laughing at me, aren't you? Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's, uh, wow.</p>
<p>This is the least tight thing that's ever happened to me.</p>
<p>I can't believe you.</p>
<p>Honestly, Jeff, how dare you? I can hear him outside.</p>
<p>He's crying.</p>
<p>Now, he's barking.</p>
<p>Jeff, wait, I'm sorry I sold you out.</p>
<p>Britta is never gonna forgive me.</p>
<p>I can't believe I showed you that poem.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, my life is Degrassi High.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff.</p>
<p>I have a gossip problem.</p>
<p>I stir the pot, Jeff.</p>
<p>I'm a pot stirrer.</p>
<p>This isn't the only study group I've had this year.</p>
<p>You see those ladies over there? I used to be in their group until they kicked me out.</p>
<p>They called me Tattle-ina.</p>
<p>It's a bumblebee nickname.</p>
<p>It's cute, but it stings.</p>
<p>Hey, look at the size of that woman's earrings.</p>
<p>It's like little dogs should be jumping through them.</p>
<p>Look at them.</p>
<p>This has to end.</p>
<p>Mm-mm-mm.</p>
<p>Shirley, don't do this.</p>
<p>Look, we can still hang out.</p>
<p>It's just, you know, we won't bag on people.</p>
<p>Come on, Jeff.</p>
<p>What are we gonna talk about? My kids, your… your doctor career?</p>
<p>I was a lawyer.</p>
<p>See, I'm already bored.</p>
<p>Well, we'll always have tiny nipples.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>They were tiny.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn't do this, but one last little piece of gossip.</p>
<p>Britta told me she had a sex dream about you.</p>
<p>You still have a chance.</p>
<p>Mm-mm! Mm.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Details.</p>
<p>Details.</p>
<p>Details.</p>
<p>Abed, here.</p>
<p>I wanted to say sorry for yelling at you.</p>

<p>I just got you the first three because… the fourth one blows.</p>
<p>We're cool.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>I do not want to talk to you.</p>
<p>No, I know, and I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm really sorry.</p>
<p>I'm really, really sorry.</p>
<p>And I will go talk to Vaughn. Vaughn broke up with me.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>You broke my trust.</p>
<p>You suck.</p>
<p>I know and I'm sorry.</p>
<p>But I was in a tough position.</p>
