<p>Really? Hi!</p>
<p>I looked everywhere.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Happy New Year! Hi.</p>
<p>Everyone have a good break? I discovered a new muscle to work out.</p>
<p>Ladies, you'll thank me come tank-top season.</p>
<p>I checked all of Pierce's wardrobes for portals to magical worlds.</p>
<p>All I found was something called Emmanuelle in Space on laser disc.</p>
<p>I couldn't watch it but it sounded sexy.</p>
<p>"Laser disc." </p>
<p>I joined a group that cleans the city.</p>
<p>We picked up litter and dredged the river.</p>
<p>Dredged it for what? You know, garbage and stuff.</p>
<p>Tires.</p>
<p>Condoms.</p>
<p>Needles.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>At one point we found a finger.</p>
<p>Why are you using your l-Iove-butterflies voice? What? Am I? I don't know.</p>
<p>Volunteer work is nice.</p>
<p>You do nice things with nice people.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Somebody's finding river fingers with a cute boy.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Well, okay, yes, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It's not like I'm seeing anyone.</p>
<p>There's just a guy.</p>
<p>Is it the Russian guy that looks like a short <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Johnny Depp</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136'>Johnny Depp</a></span><span class='years'>1963&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980'>tt0325980</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574'>tt0383574</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236'>tt0408236</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088'>tt0449088</a></span></span></span></span>?

I don't wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>I have someone in my life that I'm happy to talk about.</p>
<p>Again with the Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus is always in my life.</p>
<p>But things have been looking better every day with my ex-husband.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>White George Foreman? You guys are talking about the same person.</p>
<p>He's bi-racial, his name is David, and he's a human being.</p>
<p>Stop guessing.</p>
<p>It's just a friend.</p>
<p>Change the subject.</p>
<p>"Chang" the subject.</p>
<p>Aah! What are you doing up there? It's the beginning of a new semester of anthropology.</p>
<p>I'm here to get what I was promised.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Who has Chang's pile of nothing? You know what I mean.</p>
<p>I am sick of the runaround.</p>
<p>I'm here to demand an answer about whether I'm joining the study group.</p>
<p>If we have to give an immediate answer, it would have to be no.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Sleep on it.</p>
<p>Then get back to me, or else.</p>
<p>Jeff, you did say we would let him in eventually.</p>
<p>That was before he started using his name as a pun.</p>
<p>It makes me so Changry.</p>
<p>Oh, God, it's happening to me.</p>
<p>Let's get back to who Annie's in love with.</p>
<p>Is it Fat Neil?</p>
<p>Bluestreak?</p>
<p>Optimus Prime? I know some of these are Transformers.</p>
<p>Who cares? Let's just study.</p>
<p>We haven't had our first class yet.</p>
<p>Can we talk about something other than Annie's love life? We could talk about my love life.</p>
<p>Is it Jean Claude Van Overbite? We should learn people's names.</p>
<p>I agree with brown <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Jamie Lee Curtis</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000130'>Jamie Lee Curtis</a></span><span class='years'>1958&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>director</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159'>tt0095159</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1502407'>tt1502407</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322330'>tt0322330</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503'>tt0111503</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Duncan's late.</p>
<p>I hope he didn't drive his car into another marathon.</p>
<p>How can you wanna date your ex-husband after what he did to you? He apologized.</p>
<p>Oh, he apologized.</p>
<p>I guess that completely un-bangs that stripper.</p>
<p>Well, forgive me for being forgiving.</p>
<p>Oh, that's right, you don't know how.</p>
<p>I'm relieved Shirley is seeing her ex-husband and not Chang.</p>
<p>Why would she be with Chang? Why do I have to say everything I'm thinking? I wish my mouth was further away from my brain.</p>
<p>I wish my brain had its own brain.</p>
<p>I wish Chang hadn't had sex with Shirley.</p>
<p>What? When? Where? How? I can't talk about it.</p>
<p>Troy, I'm your roommate.</p>
<p>I can keep a secret.</p>
<p>Remember that Halloween party that none of us can remember? I don't remember anything we can remember.</p>
<p>Well, Chang left me a message that night saying they did it.</p>
<p>But you can't tell anybody.</p>
<p>You have my word as your roommate, and that is a bond I will never violate.</p>
<p>You can't tweet it either.</p>
<p>We never discussed new media.</p>
<p>Sorry all that stuff got dragged out about me having a crush on somebody.</p>
<p>Why would you be sorry about that? You know, awkward.</p>
<p>You don't think I actually care, do you? No, I just didn't want you to think I thought you cared.</p>
<p>Greetings, welcome to your second semester of anthropology where it is about to get real.</p>
<p>Now, I forget where we left off last year.</p>
<p>Uh, Fat Neil.</p>
<p>The Bronze Age? Thank you, Fat Neil.</p>
<p>Neil's fine.</p>
<p>Not from an actuarial standpoint.</p>
<p>Now, please forgive my lateness, but I wasn't sure how to find Greendale sober.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard me right, I have stopped drinking, mainly due to the fact that I could no longer get an erection.</p>
<p>Now that I'm on the wagon, you can expect both this class and my penis to be more focused and rewarding.</p>
<p>Also, there's gonna be more than one diorama.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Lame.</p>
<p>I am so sorry.</p>
<p>I train seeing-eye dogs and today was graduation.</p>
<p>I couldn't leave without shaking all their little paws.</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Annie? Rich? You're taking anthropology? You made it sound so fun.</p>
<p>We spent the holiday break dredging a river together.</p>
<p>We found A finger, yeah.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Sounds gruesome, but I'm used to seeing that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Because I'm a doctor.</p>
<p>That's terrific.</p>
<p>You're valuable.</p>
<p>I can't believe Rich actually enrolled in our class.</p>
<p>It means he likes me, right? Why wouldn't he? He is so sweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, sweet and wise.</p>
<p>He has lived such a long, full life.</p>
<p>How old is he again? Thirty-something.</p>
<p>He has a landline and uses the word "album." </p>
<p>You don't think he's too old for me? No.</p>
<p>No, come on, by that logic I wouldn't have a shot with anybody at this table.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Speaking of creepy, sober Duncan is worse than drunk Duncan.</p>
<p>This class is about to get really hard.</p>
<p>I have an idea about that.</p>
<p>Rich is really smart and he knows a lot about anthropology.</p>
<p>If we start studying with him, it could help a lot, plus, you know -- heh-heh.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what, though? I just realized.</p>
<p>So unfair to so many people, right? Britta, you're always talking about how we have no one of Latin descent.</p>
<p>Pierce, you're looking for someone old enough to find your racism subversive.</p>
<p>I could go on and on.</p>
<p>There's a process.</p>
<p>It takes time.</p>
<p>Well, then I say we gather all the candidates and make an informed, democratic decision.</p>
<p>We can have a mixer, invite the people we're submitting for consideration.</p>
<p>All in favor of tonight? Oh, I am.</p>
<p>Thank you, I'm finished.</p>
<p>No, I'd say you got about two more good years.</p>
<p>Oh, everyone, this is Andre.</p>
<p>My ex-husband and boyfriend.</p>
<p>He came to spend the day with me.</p>
<p>Hey, nice to meet you guys.</p>
<p>I've heard a lot about you.</p>
<p>We haven't heard a lot about you or what you've done or with who.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you give me a chance to make up for everything you haven't heard.</p>
<p>Hey, how about a round of soft serve on me? Isn't he handsome? Shirley, I've been fed a lot of soft serve by a lot of guys.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's rent money, sometimes it's Chili Peppers tickets.</p>
<p>And, yeah, I'll admit it, one time it was a gym bag full of nickels.</p>
<p>But it never lasts and they never change.</p>
<p>Britta, I'm a grown-ass woman and I made my decision.</p>
<p>How do you know it's the right one? Because I'm pregnant, okay? I was going to wait to share my exciting news, but now's a good time to tell you that I am eight weeks along.</p>
<p>Which is a little surprising.</p>
<p>Halloween.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming, fellow anthropology students.</p>
<p>For the first semester, you knew us as "that study group." </p>
<p>But tonight, we wanna get to know you.</p>
<p>Please forgive the spread.</p>
<p>The vending machines haven't been restocked.</p>
<p>So help yourselves to Tropical Skittles, cigarettes or mouth wash.</p>
<p>And have a good time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have to figure out if Shirley did it with her ex-husband the week after Halloween.</p>
<p>How are you gonna do that? I got moves.</p>
<p>So bun in the oven.</p>
<p>Guess it's no surprise, after working on it.</p>
<p>I wouldn't quite say working on it, just kind of happens.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>Especially when the season's right.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Dead leaves.</p>
<p>Pumpkins everywhere.</p>
<p>Nature's Viagra, right? I guess.</p>
<p>And then when all the pumpkins just start to rot and all the children have removed their outfits because they've already gotten their candy.</p>
<p>You know, I'm gonna go talk to some other people, all right? So? His mind is like a fortress.</p>
<p>Why not tell Shirley, "Look, you slept with Chang," and let her deal with it? If someone had sex with Chang and get to not remember it happened, that's a gift from God.</p>
<p>I'm not taking that away from her.</p>
<p>Here's a good reason.</p>
<p>You ever find parsley in your teeth that your friends hadn't told you about? Now imagine your teeth are a uterus, and the parsley is a half-Chinese baby.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, I want you to meet someone.</p>
<p>My name's Quendra, I spell it with a Q-U.</p>
<p>She's thinking about taking anthropology.</p>
<p>So maybe she would make a nice addition or two to our study group.</p>
<p>Something to consider.</p>
<p>Are you Abed? I love Star Wars.</p>
<p>That's Troy.</p>
<p>I love footballs.</p>
<p>We're dealing with heavier things than your shameless lobbying.</p>
<p>Rich brought kettle corn.</p>
<p>Kettle corn? That's a fun-time snack.</p>
<p>I make it in my garage.</p>
<p>I spell kettle corn with a Q-U.</p>
<p>Well, don't.</p>
<p>What is this? What's going on? It's a mixer.</p>
<p>Why is everyone from anthro class here? Are you guys picking a new study group member? You didn't invite me? Didn't know how to reach you.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? I'm everywhere.</p>
<p>We didn't know how to reach you.</p>
<p>That's not true.</p>
<p>That's a lie.</p>
<p>We didn't know how to reach you.</p>
<p>It's a mixer.</p>
<p>It's a mixer.</p>
<p>It's a mixer.</p>
<p>Works every time.</p>
<p>This is so good.</p>
<p>Fifty dollars? What a pig.</p>
<p>You can't make this at home.</p>
<p>Jeff, I think we should vote now.</p>
<p>Most people left after we ran out of Skittles.</p>
<p>And, come on, it's pretty obvious Rich is the best candidate.</p>
<p>Yeah, looks like he's our guy.</p>
<p>I'll be right there.</p>
<p>This can't be happening.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>You can't talk, then do a slow clap.</p>
<p>You don't know that.</p>
<p>But I know this.</p>
<p>Unless you want a front row seat to Annie loves Richie, it's time to "Chang" your point of view.</p>
<p>It's not even clever.</p>
<p>You keep using it as the word "change." </p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just do me a favor.</p>
<p>Let me do all the talking and follow my lead.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Seriously, do you have brain damage? Rich is also board-certified in pediatrics.</p>
<p>Once a month he flies down to volunteer in the rainforest fixing children's cleft palates and teaching them acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Other than that, well, his kettle corn speaks for itself.</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
<p>Looks like this is an open-and-shut case.</p>
<p>Did someone say case? Because I haven't made mine yet.</p>
<p>What? What's your case? Ben Chang is my case.</p>
<p>You can't be serious.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm serious, baby.</p>
<p>I am <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Yahoo Serious</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000635'>Yahoo Serious</a></span><span class='years'>1953&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>director</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>writer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6893696'>tt6893696</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156807'>tt0156807</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107930'>tt0107930</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096486'>tt0096486</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>I'm Serious FM.</p>
<p>Welcome to the World Serious of Seriousness.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Honey Nut Seri-os.</p>
<p>Are you stalling right now? Stalling? Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Stalling.</p>
<p>No, Annie.</p>
<p>In fact, you're gonna wish I was stalling.</p>
<p>Oh, I just got it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I wanna say some names to you.</p>
<p>Want some? Jeffrey Dahmer.</p>
<p>Ted Bundy.</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p>What do they have in common? We don't know them very well.</p>
<p>What do we know about Ben Chang? We know he's nuts.</p>
<p>Let him finish.</p>
<p>We know he's dangerous.</p>
<p>Unpredictable.</p>
<p>Selfish.</p>
<p>We know he uses his name to make bad puns.</p>
<p>Guilty as Chang'd.</p>
<p>When he talks, he over- and under-emphasizes words at random.</p>
<p>When he eats, he holds his fork like a murderer's knife, gnawing at its skewered payload like a deranged woodland rodent.</p>
<p>Bring it home.</p>
<p>He smells like Band-Aids.</p>
<p>We know he dresses like a Cuban cab driver.</p>
<p>We know he exhibits Nay, flaunts, proudly, obvious symptoms of over half a dozen disorders you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy's pets.</p>
<p>Feel the heat.</p>
<p>We know these things about Ben Chang.</p>
<p>And so much more than we ever wanted to know about him.</p>
<p>Why? Because it's there.</p>
<p>It's on the surface.</p>
<p>What you see may be what you don't want, but it's also what you get.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Who is this kettle corn popping phantom? This human question mark? This number eight scoop of vanilla tapioca with a PhD in Being Swell and a masters in Everybody Loves Me? Who is it? We may never know.</p>
<p>I only know one thing.</p>
<p>Nobody is this good a person.</p>
<p>And nobody can get any worse than this.</p>
<p>He's horrible.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Who's voting for Chang? Who's voting for Rich? Uh, Shirley.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>What you gonna do, baby? I don't know.</p>
<p>Shirley, this is the best kettle corn I've ever had.</p>
<p>If you don't vote for Rich, I'll shatter your world.</p>
<p>You gonna what? I'll shatter your world.</p>
<p>I heard you.</p>
<p>I vote for Chang.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>In your face.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Chang and Shirley had sex on Halloween.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What? What? What? You may be pregnant with his baby.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Pierce! She crossed me.</p>
<p>Is that why you were interrogating me about my sexual activity? Troy? Chang left me a voicemail on Halloween to say that you two did it.</p>
<p>I could hear you in the background.</p>
<p>Shirley, what is he talking about? I don't remember that night.</p>
<p>Nobody remembers anything.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Now I understand these photos.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I forward these to my brother? Oh! I want this man out of here.</p>
<p>Well, you just voted him in, so What is wrong with you? Shirley is in crisis.</p>
<p>This isn't silly anymore.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Just wait, baby.</p>
<p>I don't understand either, but we can work this out.</p>
<p>We'll figure it out.</p>
<p>Andre, no.</p>
<p>I think that this is a good time to go.</p>
<p>Rich, no.</p>
<p>You finally did it, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>You finally hurt this group in a way that will never heal.</p>
<p>Kettle corn.</p>
<p>There you are.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me what you've been doing? Well, Annie, when a man loves food and beverages very much, and they pass through his system I'm not in the mood, Jeff.</p>
<p>Explain your behavior with Rich today.</p>
<p>Sorry not everyone is as in love with Dr. Do-No-Wrong as you are.</p>
<p>And don't say it's because I'm jealous of him.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Jeff.</p>
<p>I'm sick of this.</p>
<p>One minute, I'm too young to date, the next, you're trying to get rid of guys I like.</p>
<p>Either you want me, or you don't.</p>
<p>What's it gonna be? I wish I could give you an answer that makes sense.</p>
<p>Relationships are complicated.</p>
<p>And we're in the men's room.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna ask Rich out.</p>
<p>Nothing complicated about that.</p>
<p>There you are.</p>
<p>Did I walk into the wrong bathroom? You have to find Andre and talk to him.</p>
<p>Shirley is devastated.</p>
<p>Since when do you want him in her life? I'm not a fan of the guy, but I'm a fan of Shirley and this is what she wants.</p>
<p>There you are.</p>
<p>Mezzanine? Hmm.</p>
<p>Nice sweater.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>My dad gave it to me.</p>
<p>So, um, look, I'm not mad at Shirley.</p>
<p>You're not? No, I'm mad at myself.</p>
<p>You know, if I hadn't left her like I did, none of this would've happened.</p>
<p>You ever have something that you didn't truly appreciate until you didn't have it anymore? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Keristina.</p>
<p>Old girlfriend? Almond facial scrub.</p>
<p>They only make it in Finland.</p>
<p>The old me would have been long gone by now.</p>
<p>I didn't think I could ever change but the love of a good woman makes anything possible.</p>
<p>Looks like I'm gonna be a daddy again.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, hey.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter who the baby's father is, I'm in for the long haul.</p>
<p>If it's mine, he's gonna be a great football player.</p>
<p>And if it's Chang's, we'll go for golf.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Annie just texted me.</p>
<p>She asked Rich out.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>He said no.</p>
<p>He said she's great, but too young.</p>
<p>Don't say anything until I've said what I gotta say.</p>
<p>I've known you for almost two years now, and I've never taken you as seriously as I should have.</p>
<p>You are the strangest, coolest, most genuine person I've ever met, and the thing that scares me about you is how good you make me wish I was.</p>
<p>Help me, Rich.</p>
<p>Help me become like you.</p>
<p>I mean, I am so amazing, but I'm not perfect.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>Give me that power so I can abuse it.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Jeff, you are one funny bunny.</p>
<p>You can't just fake being good in order to get away with doing bad things.</p>
<p>I completely understand.</p>
<p>And do you understand that I still have to try? And if you don't help me, you're a bad person.</p>
<p>You got me there, guy.</p>
<p>Come on in and dry off.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Smells delicious.</p>
<p>Are you baking? Yeah, muffin tops.</p>
<p>Today we'll show you how to make kettle corn with Dr. Rich.</p>
<p>How do I get one of those giant spoons? Well, actually, I carved this one myself after lighting struck an oak tree in my backyard.</p>
<p>And then, I made my nephew a rocking horse.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Smells heavenly.</p>
<p>That's adorable.</p>
<p>What sets your kettle corn apart? Well, it's a secret ingredient, a couple extra pinches of love.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You can't beat that.</p>
<p>That feels good.</p>
<p>Not this again.</p>
<p>Rich, you know they're doing a fake morning show.</p>
<p>There are no cameras.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's just a fun way to start the day.</p>
<p>So grab a paddle, partner, and hop on in here.</p>
<p>You know what, that does sound--</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
