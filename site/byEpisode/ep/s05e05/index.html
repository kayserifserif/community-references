<p>This is from all of us, Troy.</p>
<p>When you're sailing around the world, you'll be going through a lot of countries, So we got you a universal translator.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Bueno.</p>
<p>Bueno? - Cool.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>I didn't know going-away parties could be so much fun.</p>
<p>I should leave all the time.</p>
<p>Let's not forget it's okay to be sad too.</p>
<p>Britta, do you get kickbacks from big buzzkill? - I'm serious.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>The truth is, a member of our family is leaving.</p>
<p>For a year, maybe more.</p>
<p>Psychology has taught me the human mind has a tendency to rechannel separation anxiety in the form of frivolity and giddiness, and I don't want us to waste our chance to acknowledge how much we're gonna miss you.</p>
<p>Attention, Greendale.</p>
<p>Oh, announcements! Announcements! - Oh, I love these.</p>
<p>Whoo! Announcements! I'm standing here with Abed Nadir, who has chosen to give his best friend, Troy, The very special going-away present of declaring a school-wide game of hot lava! - Cool! - Ooh, that sounds like fun! Wha no! Process your feelings.</p>
<p>Hot lava is the sweet, classic children's game in which you are not allowed to touch the floor, or you're dead.</p>
<p>I think it's cute, and while I normally don't condone climbing on furniture, Troy and Abed's friendship has been such a special and magical part of Greendale, We owe it to ourselves to honor it.</p>
<p>Abed, anything to add? Yes, take this seriously.</p>
<p>Stay on furniture.</p>
<p>No books, no bags.</p>
<p>The dead can't talk.</p>
<p>No coming back as a lava monster.</p>
<p>Ooh! - Yes! Hot lava! Come on, guys, this is classic avoidance.</p>
<p>I have to go talk to him.</p>
<p>Oh, and because the non-awesome often need incentive to do awesome stuff, The final survivor will win my near mint condition number one issue of Space Clone.</p>
<p>valued by the comics authority at $50,000.</p>
<p>Wh I'm I'm sorry? The floor turns to lava in ten, nine, eight, seven Did you say 15 or 50 thousand? - Six - Oh, who am I kidding? Help, lava! Five, four, three, two Professor Duncan? You stay back, Britta! I'm not afraid to push a girl into make-believe lava.</p>
<p>In fact, it's been my primary strategy.</p>
<p>I'm staying in the game, so I can talk to Abed.</p>
<p>I'm worried about him.</p>
<p>What I'm worried about is money.</p>
<p>My self-published novels aren't going to publish themselves.</p>
<p>Don't regress to primal behavior just because it's allowed.</p>
<p>We're human beings, not the editors of Teen Vogue.</p>
<p>They're setting a terrible example for today's young women.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry, Britta, But it's either you or me And I'm me.</p>
<p>No! - Yes, yes, yes! Oh! Real nice, Winger.</p>
<p>This is why the English never win any sports.</p>
<p>'cause everyone else cheats! Britta, there you are.</p>
<p>Sweet, sweet, portable chairs.</p>
<p>Plastic gold.</p>
<p>Four-legged diamonds.</p>
<p>You claiming this? Lava joust? Did you all hit your heads on each other's heads? Let's get real, Britta.</p>
<p>Once the last of the chairs are gone, a sofa hopper like you won't last 20 minutes.</p>
<p>You want to join this alliance, - or you want to join the lava? - Fine.</p>
<p>But I'm not learning the new names for anything.</p>
<p>Centipeding isn't the fastest form of travel, But if we find more chairs, We can do the inchworm, scootenanny, The reverse Danny Thomas.</p>
<p>Do you think this game's gotten a little out of hand? Eh, feels normal enough for a school that's on 911's blocked caller list.</p>
<p>And I like that Abed wanted to send Troy off in a cool way.</p>
<p>Send him off or put off sending him? I think this imaginary lava might symbolize Abed's fear of change.</p>
<p>I think that diagnosis symbolizes your lack of a psych degree.</p>
<p>Mama mahogany, feast your feet on that stack of sticks.</p>
<p>Eh, too easy.</p>
<p>Could be a trap.</p>
<p>As if someone else is taking this game as seriously as you.</p>
<p>Let's keep this centipede rolling.</p>
<p>Give me a chair.</p>
<p>Ugh, so stupid.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Shh, shh! - Locker, locker, locker.</p>
<p>Locker, locker.</p>
<p>Locker boys! Oh! Locker! Winger, Edison, and Perry.</p>
<p>What a delicious combination.</p>
<p>Lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock! What are we getting from this extra level of commitment? We're getting your chairs, your food, and the names of your same-sex celebrity crushes.</p>
<p>Everyone has one, don't lie.</p>
<p>Then you're free to go into lava! Lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock! Ooh-whoo-ooh! Stand down or meet your doom, Chang.</p>
<p>You're in no position to make threats, floor strider.</p>
<p>Our truce ended when you banished us from the pay phone bench.</p>
<p>You used that bench to upset the balance.</p>
<p>By the Vapors of Magmarath, we will restore it.</p>
<p>You have gods? Locker boys! Earn your M&Ms! Locker! Troy and Abed intimidation stance.</p>
<p>I guess that actually looked the way it did in my head.</p>
<p>Hiya, kids.</p>
<p>I'm criminology professor Buzz Hickey, And this this is just a little something I threw together.</p>
<p>Aah! Jump! Aah!s Centipede, centipede! Okay! Pull harder! Pull harder! Pull harder! My same-sex celebrity crush is Nathan Fillion! Nathan Fillion! Jeff, Annie! Get to Shirley Island.</p>
<p>We'll meet you there.</p>
<p>Abed, save yourself! Abed, before Troy "dies in lava," you can save yourself emotionally by honestly experiencing the pain of him leaving Greendale! We can do this in three steps.</p>
<p>Britta, jump to that trash can.</p>
<p>Troy, start inchworming.</p>
<p>What's the third step? The third step's survival.</p>
<p>Good luck, Britta.</p>
<p>Seriously? Troy! Sorry, Britta, Abed knows best.</p>
<p>But I'll always remember you as kind of slowing us down and complaining a lot.</p>
<p>Oh, my no! They abandoned you? This game's doing bad things to people.</p>
<p>Now me, I'm just in it for the money.</p>
<p>My son's getting gay married.</p>
<p>The flowers alone, you have no idea.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I lived in New York.</p>
<p>All right, Miss Perry, climb aboard.</p>
<p>It's fake killing time.</p>
<p>Welcome to Shirley Island.</p>
<p>No furniture beyond this point.</p>
<p>Leave your weapons at the door and any spare doors at the entrance.</p>
<p>Then came the now-now times When the floors were covered with the burny touch.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>You made it.</p>
<p>Friends! Welcome to Shirley Island, where all your dreams come true, If you dream of standing on a table and pissing in a jar.</p>
<p>Where's Britta? She didn't make it.</p>
<p>Oh, that's too bad.</p>
<p>Poor Britta.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Her sacrifice got us this far, and now we can't lose.</p>
<p>Why not? Because now we're on Shirley Island, and according to legend -- so is the orb.</p>
<p>I'm sure I have no idea what you're speaking of.</p>
<p>This is a place of peace.</p>
<p>And profit.</p>
<p>Come again? You're not really playing, Shirley.</p>
<p>You're a merchant, and more power to you.</p>
<p>But don't withhold power from others just to make money.</p>
<p>We want the orb.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Listen, I'm still a little raw from what happened with Britta back there.</p>
<p>I mean, fun is fun, but I don't want my last day here to be a day where everyone hates me.</p>
<p>Last day? Citizens of Shirley Island! What have you brought to my door? Stay back! - My God, it's Hickey.</p>
<p>Aah! And he's got chair walkers! Come out with your feet on the floor, and there will be no need for nudging or jostling.</p>
<p>I did not skip my son's birthday for second place! I want to say something to you guys about mental health.</p>
<p>Is that Britta? Is she alive? Why did you think she was dead? We kind of left her.</p>
<p>Left her for dead? Sounds bad when you put it that way.</p>
<p>Can you put it a way that sounds good? You do realize this isn't just a pile of chairs, right? This is a crib, And you're curled up inside there, sucking your thumb, because you're too scared to say good-bye.</p>
<p>Well, it's time to grow up.</p>
<p>The adults are here, and we're gonna tear down your fort.</p>
<p>Chair walkers, attack! Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh! My name was Vicki! Tell my story! These are my only pants! I can't get them dirty! I'm actually British! Leonard! Butter 'em up! You got it! Cirque du so long, you high-stepping acro-bastards! Do you have any rolling chairs? Behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Abandon fort! Women and man-children first! Hey, seat feet! Chair to dance? Yes! Aah! Britta, I'm your friend.</p>
<p>I can't hear dead people, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm in a world of imagination.</p>
<p>Ha! Then imagine what the floor looks like.</p>
<p>I don't have to.</p>
<p>I'll just imagine where you're about to be! That's the same as imagining the floor.</p>
<p>Then you just admitted that's where you'll be.</p>
<p>Knock, knock, Britta.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna say "who's there?" because someone on the floor is knocking.</p>
<p>Well, that's lame.</p>
<p>You have to say, "who's there?" Floor! What? That's who's there! Yeah! But it's for you! Ah! Aah! Shirley, give us the orb, and we can save Shirley Island.</p>
<p>The orb can't save Shirley island because Shirley Island is the orb.</p>
<p>In a cool way like Keyser Soze or a lame way like Jew<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Keyser Soze</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814'>The Usual Suspects</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1995&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Mystery</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>Nile?

Well, I don't want to waste your time.</p>
<p>Just think of something cool and give me credit.</p>
<p>But the door I'm knocking on is your home, so if I'm the floor, it means you're dead.</p>
<p>If you're the floor, you're already dead.</p>
<p>Just do it right! Knock, knock! Knock, knock! Oh! Who's there, bitch? Floor! Floor! Aah! Oh!  Troy and Abed in a bubble  Ha! Hickey, you chicken.</p>
<p>He gutted us.</p>
<p>Retreat! Hello? Hello? I'm the only one left.</p>
<p>I won 50,000 bucks.</p>
<p>That's 50,000 lottery tickets! You can't outrun your emotions! Aah! Aah! I had a dream like this, but it was sexual.</p>
<p>I will force you two to grieve properly even if it kills us all! Go away, Britta! Oh! Aah! - Yay! - Ow! - Yay! - Ow! Ow! Sorry about our butts touching.</p>
<p>Okay, we'll go into the vents.</p>
<p>They'll never find us there.</p>
<p>I say we take a stand here.</p>
<p>I mean, someone's got to win sometime.</p>
<p>Not if we never kill each other.</p>
<p>Then we can play forever.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Abed, the floor can't be lava forever.</p>
<p>The game's got to end.</p>
<p>It's not a game for me, Troy.</p>
<p>I'm seeing real lava because you're leaving.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing, and I don't want to be crazy, but I am crazy, so I made a game that made you and everyone else see what I see.</p>
<p>I don't want it to be there either, I swear.</p>
<p>I want you to be able to leave, but I don't think the lava goes away until you stop leaving.</p>
<p>So the only way I can help you is by giving up my chance to be one person? - You guys ready for closure? - Of your caskets? Guys, stop, okay? The lava's real to Abed.</p>
<p>It's not a game to him.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>You know what I think? I think he's used to getting his own way.</p>
<p>I think he's never met me.</p>
<p>Aah! - No! Abed! Abed.</p>
<p>Uh! Unbelievable.</p>
<p>When this game is over, I'm gonna shove you back.</p>
<p>Abed, give me your other hand! It's down to us.</p>
<p>You or Britta will be the winner.</p>
<p>I'm not leaving, okay? Just I promise.</p>
<p>Just the floor's not lava now.</p>
<p>Just give me your hand.</p>
<p>I don't think the lava's here because you're leaving.</p>
<p>I think it's here because I won't let go.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed! Abed! Abed! Abed!  Abed.</p>
<p>He's he's fake dead.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>El esta muerto para siempre.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Callate.</p>
<p>What? - Que? - Stop! - Para.</p>
<p>He's not really dead.</p>
<p>No, but he's really playing dead, and he's not gonna stop.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you win.</p>
<p>You don't get it.</p>
<p>No one gets Abed.</p>
<p>I got him a little.</p>
<p>This is my fault.</p>
<p>I don't deserve to fake live.</p>
<p>Wait! No.</p>
<p>I can fix it.</p>
<p>How? I-I don't know.</p>
<p>In real life, I don't know, but I can fake fix him.</p>
<p>Uh, I can clone him.</p>
<p>I'll clone him.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>I just need his DNA.</p>
<p>Let's get his DNA.</p>
<p>Don't touch the lava.</p>
<p>You might be onto something.</p>
<p>I'm gonna find discarded technology From this once great civilization And start a cloning machine.</p>
<p>Mm! Okay, I'm placing this cellular regeneration sequencer on the spot where he died.</p>
<p>Here, don't forget this.</p>
<p>This is a laser guidance system that keeps the regeneration sequence from, um jib-jabbing.</p>
<p>Jib-jabbing? Initiate regeneration sequence.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>We made a perfect clone of Abed.</p>
<p>Actually, Britta's work was sloppy.</p>
<p>I'm not an exact replication.</p>
<p>I have all of Abed's abilities and memories, but I'm missing his wild emotionality.</p>
<p>Although I think I may be able to let Troy go now.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I haven't been completely honest.</p>
<p>I'm really scared to go on my trip.</p>
<p>Well, you don't have to go.</p>
<p>Your clone can.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you guys are all cloned up too, huh? Yeah, believe in cloning.</p>
<p>Well, guess that's my ride.</p>
<p>I'm so excited for you.</p>
<p>You're gonna see the world and experience new cultures.</p>
<p>I mean, technically all culture has been homogenized by 50 years of American imperialism, But at least the candy bar wrappers will God, there I go.</p>
<p>Almost Britta'd our good-bye, huh? I'm the worst.</p>
<p>You're the best, and I love you.</p>
<p>I'm better at sex than Jeff, right? I've yet to have anyone worse.</p>
<p>All I ever wanted in high school was for Troy Barnes yo notice me, and then I ended up living with you.</p>
<p>I'm pretty lucky.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>I had a chance to be your friend in high school, but I was too busy trying to be cool.</p>
<p>I missed out on four more years of Annie.</p>
<p>Aw! You are the coolest guy I know.</p>
<p>I hope I make you proud.</p>
<p>I've never stepped foot outside of Colorado.</p>
<p>You're becoming much cooler than me by doing this.</p>
<p>Thanks for looking out for me.</p>
<p>Thank you for putting up with the boring, old mom in your college study group.</p>
<p>You made a furniture fortress.</p>
<p>You're the badass from our study group.</p>
<p>Clone Troy.</p>
<p>Clone Abed.</p>
<p>By the way, when I cloned you, I had to patch some missing parts of your DNA with genes from a homing pigeon.</p>
<p>You may notice side effects, like a compulsion to come back.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Clone hug? So you're really just gonna pilot this thing all on your own? Well, Pierce's will stated that someone would be assigned to travel with me - to verify that I don't cheat.</p>
<p>Captain Barnes.</p>
<p>We should probably set sail while the wind is still in our favor, don't you think? Engage.</p>
<p># A gathering of angels #</p>
<p># Appeared above my head#</p>
<p>Now, Troy, I know it's gonna be difficult for you to interact with me --</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That was the original Troy.</p>
<p>I'm his clone.</p>
<p>Let's get the lead out, Burton.</p>
<p>Aye, aye, sir.</p>
<p># They said, come sail away, come sail away #</p>
<p># Come sail away with me, that's #</p>
<p># Come sail away, come sail away #</p>
<p># Come sail away with me #</p>
<p>You know, starting a sea voyage from landlocked Colorado -</p>
<p>May not have been the best idea.</p>
<p>We'll drive to the river and then take the river to the ocean.</p>
<p>Actually, I never thought I'd see you again.</p>
<p>I have a couple Star Trek questions, if you don't mind.</p>
<p>No, go ahead.</p>
<p>What time di<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Star Trek</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366'>Star Trek</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>2009&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span><span class='tag genre'>Sci-Fi</span></span></span></span>s have to get up in the morning? Does every writer write for one character? What's a best boy? I saw it in the credits once.</p>
<p>Why don't they call it Planet Trek? You never go to a star.</p>
<p>You - not one episode.</p>
