<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>How do we turn this off? Can you help me turn this off? Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>How do we turn this off? Can you help me with this? Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to snap.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Many of you are halfway through your first week here at Greendale, and as your dean I thought I would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration.</p>
<p>What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things.</p>
<p>You've heard it's loser college for remedial teens, middle-aged divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity.</p>
<p>That's what you've heard.</p>
<p>However, I wish you luck.</p>
<p>Okay, you know. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Okay, there's more to this speech.</p>
<p>There's actually a middle card that is missing.</p>
<p>Can we all look around our immediate areas? Because I really wanted to…</p>
<p>I'm only half Arabic, actually.</p>
<p>My dad is Palestinian.</p>
<p>He's a U.S. citizen, he's not a threat to national security or anything.</p>
<p>Lot of people want to know after they meet him because he has angry energy.</p>
<p>Not like angry at America, just angry at my mom for leaving.</p>
<p>Although she did leave because he was angry.</p>
<p>And he was angry because she's American.</p>
<p>My name's Abed, by the way.</p>
<p>Abed, nice to know you and then meet you, in that order.</p>
<p>Now about that question that I had? Oh, uh, five after 11 when you asked.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's the deal with the hot girl from Spanish class? I can't find a road in there.</p>
<p>Well, I only talked to her once while she was borrowing a pencil.</p>
<p>Her name is Britta, she has two older brothers.</p>
<p>One works with children who have a disorder I might wanna look up.</p>
<p>And she thinks she's gonna flunk tomorrow's test.</p>
<p>So she really needs to focus.</p>
<p>And she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Abed, I see your value now.</p>
<p>That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>If these guys knew you like I did, they would have given you a small office.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger, genius at law.</p>
<p>You gotta stop saying that.</p>
<p>I will never do that.</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>I still cannot figure out how you got a jury to connect September the 11th with my DUI, let alone why that helped.</p>
<p>Well, 2002 was a simpler time.</p>
<p>So, what is my lawyer doing here? I'm a student.</p>
<p>Well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.</p>
<p>I am in a bit of a jam.</p>
<p>The state bar has suspended my license.</p>
<p>They found out my college degree was less than legitimate.</p>
<p>I thought you had a bachelor's from Columbia.</p>
<p>Now I have to get one from America.</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>And it can't be an e-mail attachment.</p>
<p>Well, you've picked a fine school.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I'm hoping that our friendship will yield certain advantages.</p>
<p>You know, academic guidance.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Moral support.</p>
<p>Every answer to every test for every one of the classes that I'm taking.</p>
<p>Here's my schedule.</p>
<p>Now, Jeff, just by asking that you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution.</p>
<p>Oi.</p>
<p>Waster.</p>
<p>Not a bathroom.</p>
<p>Not a bathroom.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Duncan, you did seem less into integrity the day that I convinced that when you made that U-turn on the freeway and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box that your only real crime was loving America.</p>
<p>Well, I do love America.</p>
<p>I love it very much.</p>
<p>Mm? I love chalupas.</p>
<p>But I'll look into it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Duncan, you are a good man.</p>
<p>Jeff, are you familiar with the adage "Cheaters never prosper"? No.</p>
<p>And if I wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Spanish.</p>
<p>Yeah, don't hit on me, okay? Uh, I wouldn't dream of it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know about my Spanish study group.</p>
<p>Oh, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>The guy who's playing "Bejeweled" on his iPhone all class has a study group? Can I sign up twice? I'm taking the class as an easy credit.</p>
<p>I'm actually a Spanish tutor.</p>
<p>Board certified.</p>
<p>Can you say that in Spanish now? I really need help with Spanish.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was willing to bet.</p>
<p>I'm Jeff.</p>
<p>Or jefe.</p>
<p>The group meets at the library at 4.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>You're gonna be there? That means, "See you there." Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? Huh? Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I was raised on TV, and I was conditioned to believe that every black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor.</p>
<p>Were you conditioned to pay for your damn tacos, Seinfield? Yes.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>It's "Seinfeld." Hey, all right, come on in.</p>
<p>I've got the whole table.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Yeah, the whole room.</p>
<p>Here's the contact sheet.</p>
<p>Just put your stuff there.</p>
<p>Man, the rest of the group is running late.</p>
<p>But you and I can get acquainted.</p>
<p>You may have noticed this morning, not so good at the small talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like big talk.</p>
<p>What's your deal? That's not small talk? What's your deal and is God dead? All right, you wanna know my deal? Mm.</p>
<p>I dropped out of high school because I thought for some reason it would impress Radiohead.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised what gets back to those guys.</p>
<p>I joined the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>I did a little foot modeling.</p>
<p>I got tear gassed at a world trade rally.</p>
<p>Marry me.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>And I guess, Jeff, my deal is, above all else, honesty.</p>
<p>Honesty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You tell me the truth, I will like you.</p>
<p>You lie to me, I will never talk to you again.</p>
<p>That's my deal.</p>
<p>That's a good deal.</p>
<p>So, what's your deal? Uh, I would have to go, I would have to say, um, honesty.</p>
<p>Because I would say anything to get what I want, and I want you to like me.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, that's a very honest answer.</p>
<p>All right, for now, I like you fine.</p>
<p>Really? Wow.</p>
<p>You're easy.</p>
<p>Hell, yeah.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>In the house.</p>
<p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo.</p>
<p>Why? Britta invited me.</p>
<p>Is that cool? Oh, I can't think of a single logical reason why not.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, here.</p>
<p>Put your contact info down right there.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast Club, huh? We are in a library.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside that would make us cry if we talked about it.</p>
<p>Do you have something balled up inside you? Oh, I got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.</p>
<p>Hey, text message.</p>
<p>Let's give this bad boy a read.</p>
<p>It's probably just for you.</p>
<p>I've never gotten one of these.</p>
<p>Uh, it's probably, you just, it's just for your eyes.</p>
<p>"Say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."</p>
<p>"Say you have to pee."</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>"Say you have to pee."</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have to pee? No.</p>
<p>That's so weird.</p>
<p>Well, I'm stumped.</p>
<p>That's very creepy.</p>
<p>That makes two of us.</p>
<p>What's that? Does it say you have to pee? No, it's just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation.</p>
<p>I just need five minutes, you guys.</p>
<p>So go ahead and study all the verbs in Spanish.</p>
<p>Abed, what's your read on that guy? Yeah.</p>
<p>You look like <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Elisabeth Shue</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000223'>Elisabeth Shue</a></span><span class='years'>1963&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120053'>tt0120053</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113627'>tt0113627</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164052'>tt0164052</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092513'>tt0092513</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Just act natural, pretend you're watching the athletic proceedings.</p>
<p>You couldn't stop me from watching them.</p>
<p>There's a guy trying out for track that is older than the game of poker.</p>
<p>He's kind of trucking.</p>
<p>Suppose I was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers.</p>
<p>I would say go for that.</p>
<p>And could have said so in a text.</p>
<p>I'm asking if you know the difference between right and wrong.</p>
<p>I discovered at a very early age that if I talked long enough, I could make anything right or wrong.</p>
<p>So either I'm God or truth is relative, and in either case, booyah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>It's just, the average person has a much harder time saying booyah to moral relativism.</p>
<p>Duncan, you don't have to play shrink to protect your pride.</p>
<p>I accept you're chicken.</p>
<p>You trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist? No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless British twit.</p>
<p>I'm a professor.</p>
<p>You can't talk to me that way.</p>
<p>A 6-year-old girl could.</p>
<p>Yes, because that would be adorable.</p>
<p>No, because you're a 5-year-old girl, and there's a pecking order.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll do it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, with pleasure.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Yes, good.</p>
<p>Why am I still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.</p>
<p>You guys aren't going to believe this but the rest of the group is here.</p>
<p>Are you the board-certified tutor? That means you do my homework, right, <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Seacrest</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780435'>Ryan Seacrest</a></span><span class='years'>1974&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>writer</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4118584'>tt4118584</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319931'>tt0319931</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425061'>tt0425061</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892791'>tt0892791</a></span></span></span></span>? I need to call my babysitter if we gonna be late.</p>
<p>What board certifies a tutor? Where's Britta? Not sure.</p>
<p>I invited people from Spanish class.</p>
<p>Is that cool? It's the coolest.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>And bring my jacket, wallet and keys with me in case there's a fire.</p>
<p>Should we go with him? Gonna leave my homework with Slumdog Millionaire.</p>
<p>That's borderline racist.</p>
<p>And busted.</p>
<p>Listen, now you know.</p>
<p>I'm a smoker.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.</p>
<p>You ready to get started? Looks like your group showed up.</p>
<p>Not mine.</p>
<p>I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist.</p>
<p>And I was trained never to say this, but I think that group may be untutorable.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Why don't you and I go study over dinner? Or drinks.</p>
<p>I think, actually, we should prioritize here and study first and then go to dinner.</p>
<p>And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.</p>
<p>Oh, they will be untutorable.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Look at this crew.</p>
<p>All ready to study all night.</p>
<p>I can stay at least till 10.</p>
<p>But who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff, it's a pleasure.</p>
<p>My name is Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>And, yes, that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes the award-winning moist towelette.</p>
<p>I was just gonna ask.</p>
<p>I'm a toastmaster.</p>
<p>I should do the introductions.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>You know Brittles.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed the Arab.</p>
<p>Is that inappropriate? Sure.</p>
<p>Roy, Roy, the wonder boy Troy.</p>
<p>Little princess Elizabeth Annie.</p>
<p>And, finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.</p>
<p>Is that even close? I'd like to know why I had to find out about this group on accident.</p>
<p>Way more like Breakfast Club now.</p>
<p>There's breakfast?</p>
<p>We should get started.</p>
<p>I've been a part of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we address Annie's concern? Did we not invite her?</p>
<p>Sweetie, it's not behind your back --</p>
<p>Can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions.</p>
<p>Shirley has a response to that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>It looks like you do.</p>
<p>Shirley, go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions.</p>
<p>And maybe Annie's decisions will be better.</p>
<p>I think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child or an adult, because children get pity, but not respect, and adults, they get respect.</p>
<p>They also get their head grabbed and pushed through jukeboxes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in Spanish? What are you doing? Pierce.</p>
<p>Let's discuss this creepiness.</p>
<p>Pardon you? What are you doing? I'm certified.</p>
<p>Are you unaware that Shirley finds your advances inappropriate? What advances? You have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class.</p>
<p>Sexually harassing? What? That makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Why would I harass somebody who turns me on? Saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I am a prominent business leader and a highly sought-after dinner guest.</p>
<p>And I will not take courting advice from some teenage boy.</p>
<p>Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king.</p>
<p>You're not prom king anymore, Troy.</p>
<p>This isn't Riverside High.</p>
<p>How'd you know I went there? Because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket, and, more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.</p>
<p>Were you that girl got hooked on pills and dropped out? You're little Annie Adderall.</p>
<p>And you're a stupid jock who lost scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.</p>
<p>Keg flip.</p>
<p>They're very hard to pull off.</p>
<p>Don't talk to me.</p>
<p>You don't know I'm a legend.</p>
<p>You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family.</p>
<p>I got a carton of cigarettes.</p>
<p>The old man grabbed me.</p>
<p>He said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny."</p>
<p>No, Dad, what about you?</p>
<p>Well, that actually was from The Breakfast Club.</p>
<p>Nobody puts Baby in the corner.</p>
<p>Dirty Dancing.</p>
<p>Hello? It's Professor Duncan.</p>
<p>Come to the parking lot now.</p>
<p>What's wrong with your voice? I'm disguising it.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out.</p>
<p>No stone unturned.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Get in the car.</p>
<p>Act as if we've either just finished or are yet to begin driving.</p>
<p>Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.</p>
<p>I knew you could do it, buddy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Whoa, there, grabby grabby.</p>
<p>What do I get? The satisfaction of being even.</p>
<p>Even, fairness, right, wrong.</p>
<p>There is no God.</p>
<p>Booyah, booyah.</p>
<p>What do you want from me? Your Lexus.</p>
<p>My car for a semester's worth of answers? Will it be just a semester, though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance.</p>
<p>I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.</p>
<p>You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.</p>
<p>Have a nice disbarment hearing.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to drive? Take this car.</p>
<p>It's good for the earth.</p>
<p>So is wiping your butt with a leaf but it's not how a man gets around.</p>
<p>Golf cart.</p>
<p>It is a disaster in there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Untutorable.</p>
<p>Do you like Thai food? I love Thai food.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>So this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants? Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It was an accident.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of lying to get close to you.</p>
<p>But how was I supposed to know that you were smart and cool.</p>

<p>You're unbelievable.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do? Maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.</p>
<p>Okay, if I do that, then dinner, right? Yeah, fine, whatever.</p>
<p>As if there's a dinner on earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douche bag.</p>
<p>Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>I wanna say something.</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>Well, you don't have to yell.</p>
<p>I don't appreciate your tone.</p>
<p>What makes humans different from other animals? Feet.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Come on, bears have feet.</p>
<p>We're the only species on earth that observes "Shark Week."</p>
<p>Sharks don't even observe "Shark Week," but we do.</p>
<p>For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you its name is Steve and go like this.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside.</p>

<p>Big mistake.</p>
<p>People can find the good in just about anything but themselves.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>It's clear to all of you that I am awesome.</p>
<p>But I could never admit that.</p>
<p>That would make me an ass.</p>
<p>But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome.</p>
<p>She's driven.</p>
<p>We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts.</p>
<p>And Pierce, we need guys like Pierce.</p>
<p>This guy has wisdom to offer.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama and I--</p>
<p>We should listen to him some time.</p>
<p>We wouldn't regret it.</p>
<p>And Shirley, Shirley has earned our respect.</p>
<p>Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman.</p>
<p>Don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was too specific to be improvised.</p>
<p>And Troy.</p>
<p>Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is.</p>
<p>You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No, they're trying to impress their high school's prom king.</p>
<p>And Abed.</p>
<p>Abed's a shaman.</p>
<p>You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup.</p>
<p>Because you know what, soup is better.</p>
<p>Abed is better.</p>
<p>You are all better than you think you are.</p>
<p>You are designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.</p>
<p>Soup? I want you to look to the person to your left.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Look at the person sitting next to you.</p>
<p>Look at her.</p>

<p>This? Yeah.</p>

<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>You little twerp.</p>
<p>Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."</p>
<p>He didn't say it? I forgive you.</p>
<p>You've just stopped being a study group.</p>
<p>You have become something unstoppable.</p>
<p>I hereby pronounce you a community.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore.</p>

<p>I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special.</p>
<p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.</p>
<p>Britta? I lied.</p>
<p>Thanks for calming everyone down.</p>
<p>But since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.</p>
<p>Everybody ready? Fine.</p>
<p>And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test.</p>
<p>And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I wasted more than they wasted mine.</p>
<p>Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this group? I don't have a study group.</p>
<p>I made it up.</p>
<p>What about the speech? Made it up.</p>
<p>That's what I do.</p>
<p>I make things up.</p>
<p>And I got paid a lot of money to do it.</p>
<p>Before I came to this school-shaped toilet, I was a lawyer.</p>

<p>Burger for your ass.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, before you say anything, you might want to think about the gift you've been given.</p>
<p>An excuse to punch a hippy? No.</p>
<p>No, not that.</p>
<p>An important lesson, my friend.</p>
<p>You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale.</p>
<p>What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.</p>
<p>Why are people trying to teach me things at a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me my keys.</p>
<p>No, I have to keep your car for the lesson.</p>
<p>Don't hit me.</p>
<p>Please don't hit me.</p>
<p>Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Are we cool? Are we cool? We cool.</p>
<p>I like you, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You remind me of myself at your age.</p>
<p>I deserve that.</p>
<p>You know I've been divorced seven times? Sometimes I think I'm doing something wrong.</p>
<p>You keep getting married.</p>
<p>I never looked at it that way.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you guys be studying? Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something.</p>
<p>People have been clowning me about this jacket since I got here.</p>
<p>But, if I take it off to make them happy, that just makes me weak, right? Listen, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off.</p>
<p>Either way, it's for them.</p>
<p>That's what's weak.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>You just wrinkled my brain, man.</p>
<p>He's good, isn't he? He's real good.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers? I don't have any of the answers.</p>
<p>I'm gonna flunk the test.</p>
<p>If you just, like, study for an hour, it's not that hard.</p>
<p>You seem pretty smart.</p>
<p>You got a sports coat.</p>
<p>Well, the funny thing about being smart is you can get through most of life without having to do work.</p>
<p>So I'm not really sure how to do that.</p>
<p>Please? So sad? He makes me wanna--</p>
<p>What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now? Yes.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>You know what, Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you.</p>
<p>So if you wanna come back upstairs…</p>

Hey, all right, come on in.</p>
<p>I've got the whole table.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Yeah, the whole room.</p>
<p>Here's the contact sheet.</p>
<p>Just put your stuff there.</p>
<p>Man, the rest of the group is running late.</p>
<p>But you and I can get acquainted.</p>
<p>You may have noticed this morning, not so good at the small talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like big talk.</p>
<p>What's your deal? That's not small talk? What's your deal and is God dead? All right, you wanna know my deal? Mm.</p>
<p>I dropped out of high school because I thought for some reason it would impress Radiohead.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised what gets back to those guys.</p>
<p>I joined the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>I did a little foot modeling.</p>
<p>I got tear gassed at a world trade rally.</p>
<p>Marry me.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>And I guess, Jeff, my deal is, above all else, honesty.</p>
<p>Honesty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You tell me the truth, I will like you.</p>
<p>You lie to me, I will never talk to you again.</p>
<p>That's my deal.</p>
<p>That's a good deal.</p>
<p>So, what's your deal? Uh, I would have to go, I would have to say, um, honesty.</p>
<p>Because I would say anything to get what I want, and I want you to like me.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, that's a very honest answer.</p>
<p>All right, for now, I like you fine.</p>
<p>Really? Wow.</p>
<p>You're easy.</p>
<p>Hell, yeah.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>In the house.</p>
<p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo.</p>
<p>Why? Britta invited me.</p>
<p>Is that cool? Oh, I can't think of a single logical reason why not.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>

We are in a library.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside that would make us cry if we talked about it.</p>
<p>Do you have something balled up inside you? Oh, I got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.</p>
<p>Hey, text message.</p>
<p>Let's give this bad boy a read.</p>
<p>It's probably just for you.</p>
<p>I've never gotten one of these.</p>
<p>Uh, it's probably, you just, it's just for your eyes.</p>
<p>"Say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."</p>
<p>"Say you have to pee."</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>"Say you have to pee."</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have to pee? No.</p>
<p>That's so weird.</p>
<p>Well, I'm stumped.</p>
<p>That's very creepy.</p>
<p>That makes two of us.</p>
<p>What's that? Does it say you have to pee? No, it's just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation.</p>
<p>I just need five minutes, you guys.</p>
<p>So go ahead and study all the verbs in Spanish.</p>
<p>Abed, what's your read on that guy? Yeah.</p>
<p>You look like Elisabeth Shue.</p>
<p>Just act natural, pretend you're watching the athletic proceedings.</p>
<p>You couldn't stop me from watching them.</p>
<p>There's a guy trying out for track that is older than the game of poker.</p>
<p>He's kind of trucking.</p>
<p>Suppose I was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers.</p>
<p>I would say go for that.</p>
<p>And could have said so in a text.</p>
<p>I'm asking if you know the difference between right and wrong.</p>
<p>I discovered at a very early age that if I talked long enough, I could make anything right or wrong.</p>
<p>So either I'm God or truth is relative, and in either case, booyah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>It's just, the average person has a much harder time saying booyah to moral relativism.</p>
<p>Duncan, you don't have to play shrink to protect your pride.</p>
<p>I accept you're chicken.</p>
<p>You trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist? No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless British twit.</p>
<p>I'm a professor.</p>
<p>You can't talk to me that way.</p>
<p>A 6-year-old girl could.</p>
<p>Yes, because that would be adorable.</p>
<p>No, because you're a 5-year-old girl, and there's a pecking order.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll do it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, with pleasure.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Yes, good.</p>
<p>Why am I still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.</p>
<p>You guys aren't going to believe this but the rest of the group is here.</p>
<p>Are you the board-certified tutor? That means you do my homework, right, Seacrest? I need to call my babysitter if we gonna be late.</p>
<p>What board certifies a tutor? Where's Britta? Not sure.</p>
<p>I invited people from Spanish class.</p>
<p>Is that cool? It's the coolest.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>And bring my jacket, wallet and keys with me in case there's a fire.</p>

<p>That's borderline racist.</p>
<p>And busted.</p>
<p>Listen, now you know.</p>
<p>I'm a smoker.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.</p>
<p>You ready to get started? Looks like your group showed up.</p>
<p>Not mine.</p>
<p>I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist.</p>
<p>And I was trained never to say this, but I think that group may be untutorable.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Why don't you and I go study over dinner? Or drinks.</p>
<p>I think, actually, we should prioritize here and study first and then go to dinner.</p>
<p>And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.</p>
<p>Oh, they will be untutorable.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Look at this crew.</p>
<p>All ready to study all night.</p>
<p>I can stay at least till 10.</p>
<p>But who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff, it's a pleasure.</p>
<p>My name is Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>And, yes, that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes the award-winning moist towelette.</p>
<p>I was just gonna ask.</p>
<p>I'm a toastmaster.</p>
<p>I should do the introductions.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>You know Brittles.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed the Arab.</p>
<p>Is that inappropriate? Sure.</p>
<p>Roy, Roy, the wonder boy Troy.</p>
<p>Little princess Elizabeth Annie.</p>
<p>And, finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.</p>
<p>Is that even close? I'd like to know why I had to find out about this group on accident.</p>

<p>There's breakfast?</p>
<p>We should get started.</p>
<p>I've been a part of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we address Annie's concern? Did we not invite her?</p>
<p>Sweetie, it's not behind your back --</p>
<p>Can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions.</p>
<p>Shirley has a response to that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>It looks like you do.</p>
<p>Shirley, go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions.</p>
<p>And maybe Annie's decisions will be better.</p>
<p>I think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child or an adult, because children get pity, but not respect, and adults, they get respect.</p>
<p>They also get their head grabbed and pushed through jukeboxes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in Spanish? What are you doing? Pierce.</p>
<p>Let's discuss this creepiness.</p>
<p>Pardon you? What are you doing? I'm certified.</p>
<p>Are you unaware that Shirley finds your advances inappropriate? What advances? You have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class.</p>
<p>Sexually harassing? What? That makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Why would I harass somebody who turns me on? Saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I am a prominent business leader and a highly sought-after dinner guest.</p>
<p>And I will not take courting advice from some teenage boy.</p>
<p>Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king.</p>
<p>You're not prom king anymore, Troy.</p>
<p>This isn't Riverside High.</p>
<p>How'd you know I went there? Because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket, and, more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.</p>
<p>Were you that girl got hooked on pills and dropped out? You're little Annie Adderall.</p>
<p>And you're a stupid jock who lost scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.</p>

<p>They're very hard to pull off.</p>
<p>Don't talk to me.</p>
<p>You don't know I'm a legend.</p>
<p>You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family.</p>
<p>I got a carton of cigarettes.</p>

<p>Hello? It's Professor Duncan.</p>
<p>Come to the parking lot now.</p>
<p>What's wrong with your voice? I'm disguising it.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out.</p>
<p>No stone unturned.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Get in the car.</p>
<p>Act as if we've either just finished or are yet to begin driving.</p>
<p>Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.</p>
<p>I knew you could do it, buddy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Whoa, there, grabby grabby.</p>
<p>What do I get? The satisfaction of being even.</p>
<p>Even, fairness, right, wrong.</p>
<p>There is no God.</p>
<p>Booyah, booyah.</p>
<p>What do you want from me? Your Lexus.</p>
<p>My car for a semester's worth of answers? Will it be just a semester, though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance.</p>
<p>I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.</p>
<p>You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.</p>
<p>Have a nice disbarment hearing.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to drive? Take this car.</p>
<p>It's good for the earth.</p>
<p>So is wiping your butt with a leaf but it's not how a man gets around.</p>
<p>Golf cart.</p>
<p>It is a disaster in there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Untutorable.</p>
<p>Do you like Thai food? I love Thai food.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>So this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants? Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It was an accident.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of lying to get close to you.</p>
<p>But how was I supposed to know that you were smart and cool.</p>
<p>You look like Elisabeth Shue.</p>
<p>You're unbelievable.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do? Maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.</p>
<p>Okay, if I do that, then dinner, right? Yeah, fine, whatever.</p>
<p>As if there's a dinner on earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douche bag.</p>
<p>Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>I wanna say something.</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>Well, you don't have to yell.</p>
<p>I don't appreciate your tone.</p>
<p>What makes humans different from other animals? Feet.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Come on, bears have feet.</p>
<p>We're the only species on earth that observes "Shark Week."</p>
<p>Sharks don't even observe "Shark Week," but we do.</p>
<p>For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you its name is Steve and go like this.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside.</p>
<p>Because people can connect with anything.</p>
<p>We can sympathize with a pencil, we can forgive a shark, and we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for screenwriting.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>
<p>People can find the good in just about anything but themselves.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>It's clear to all of you that I am awesome.</p>
<p>But I could never admit that.</p>
<p>That would make me an ass.</p>
<p>But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome.</p>
<p>She's driven.</p>
<p>We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts.</p>
<p>And Pierce, we need guys like Pierce.</p>
<p>This guy has wisdom to offer.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama and I--</p>
<p>We should listen to him some time.</p>
<p>We wouldn't regret it.</p>
<p>And Shirley, Shirley has earned our respect.</p>
<p>Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman.</p>
<p>Don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was too specific to be improvised.</p>
<p>And Troy.</p>
<p>Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is.</p>
<p>You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No, they're trying to impress their high school's prom king.</p>
<p>And Abed.</p>
<p>Abed's a shaman.</p>
<p>You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup.</p>
<p>Because you know what, soup is better.</p>
<p>Abed is better.</p>
<p>You are all better than you think you are.</p>
<p>You are designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.</p>
<p>Soup? I want you to look to the person to your left.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Look at the person sitting next to you.</p>
<p>Look at her.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This? Yeah.</p>
<p>I want you to extend to that person the same compassion you extend to sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck.</p>
<p>I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>You little twerp.</p>
<p>Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."</p>
<p>He didn't say it? I forgive you.</p>
<p>You've just stopped being a study group.</p>
<p>You have become something unstoppable.</p>
<p>I hereby pronounce you a community.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>This isn't like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Breakfast Club</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088847'>The Breakfast Club</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1985&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span></span></span></span> anymore.</p>

<p>Anything with Bill Murray.</p>
<p>I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special.</p>
<p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.</p>
<p>Britta? I lied.</p>
<p>Thanks for calming everyone down.</p>
<p>But since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.</p>
<p>Everybody ready? Fine.</p>
<p>And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test.</p>
<p>And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I wasted more than they wasted mine.</p>
<p>Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this group? I don't have a study group.</p>
<p>I made it up.</p>
<p>What about the speech? Made it up.</p>
<p>That's what I do.</p>
<p>I make things up.</p>
<p>And I got paid a lot of money to do it.</p>
<p>Before I came to this school-shaped toilet, I was a lawyer.</p>
<p>Oh, man, this ruins everything.</p>
<p>I thought you were like Bill Murray in his films.</p>
<p>But you're more like Michael Douglas in his films.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, you have Asperger's.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Ass burger.</p>
<p>It's a serious disorder.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis? Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Ass burger.</p>
<p>Burger for your ass.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, before you say anything, you might want to think about the gift you've been given.</p>
<p>An excuse to punch a hippy? No.</p>
<p>No, not that.</p>
<p>An important lesson, my friend.</p>
<p>You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale.</p>
<p>What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.</p>
<p>Why are people trying to teach me things at a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me my keys.</p>
<p>No, I have to keep your car for the lesson.</p>
<p>Don't hit me.</p>
<p>Please don't hit me.</p>
<p>Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Are we cool? Are we cool? We cool.</p>
<p>I like you, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You remind me of myself at your age.</p>
<p>I deserve that.</p>
<p>You know I've been divorced seven times? Sometimes I think I'm doing something wrong.</p>
<p>You keep getting married.</p>
<p>I never looked at it that way.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you guys be studying? Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something.</p>
<p>People have been clowning me about this jacket since I got here.</p>
<p>But, if I take it off to make them happy, that just makes me weak, right? Listen, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off.</p>
<p>Either way, it's for them.</p>
<p>That's what's weak.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>You just wrinkled my brain, man.</p>
<p>He's good, isn't he? He's real good.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers? I don't have any of the answers.</p>
<p>I'm gonna flunk the test.</p>
<p>If you just, like, study for an hour, it's not that hard.</p>
<p>You seem pretty smart.</p>
<p>You got a sports coat.</p>
<p>Well, the funny thing about being smart is you can get through most of life without having to do work.</p>
<p>So I'm not really sure how to do that.</p>
<p>Please? So sad? He makes me wanna--</p>
<p>What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now? Yes.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>You know what, Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you.</p>
<p>So if you wanna come back upstairs…</p>
<p>Really? Well, it is your study group, so…</p>
<p>Come on, let's study.</p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Pressure.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas.</p>
<p>And I see your value now.</p>
<p>That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.</p>
