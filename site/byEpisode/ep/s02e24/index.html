<p>Dean? Dean? Don't shoot, red-haired guy.</p>
<p>Why not? Something's not right about the game.</p>
<p>We just took out a professional paintball assassin.</p>
<p>A professional? Aah! That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Why would someone who gets paid to do things be at Greendale? Aah! No! No, no! I'm not playing! I'm not playing! No, I'm the dean! Stop shooting me! Aah! - Man's down.</p>
<p>Copy that.</p>
<p>Hi, Pistol Patty.</p>
<p>Did they take you hostage? Dean Spreck? Hello, Craig.</p>
<p>City College.</p>
<p>Now I understand everything.</p>
<p>Now your whole evil plan is clear as day.</p>
<p>But if you need to explain it to your men, I understand.</p>
<p>It's simple, Craig.</p>
<p>I pose as a fake ice cream company, sponsor your end-of-the-year picnic and waved enough money under your students' noses to provoke them to destroy their own campus.</p>
<p>Who hurt you, Steven? How could any dean be so mean? Oh, you haven't seen how mean this dean can be-ean.</p>
<p>There's one.</p>
<p>Go! - After them.</p>
<p>Go, go, go! Wait, did you say "bean"? Guys.</p>
<p>Guys! City College is trying to destroy Greendale.</p>
<p>They're an unstoppable juggle knob.</p>
<p>"Juggernaut." </p>
<p>Juggernaut.</p>
<p>Which means, if we're gonna fight them, we have to form a school-wide alliance of rebels.</p>
<p>It seems we've left the Western motif and are entering a Star Wars scenario.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I wish it happened sooner too.</p>
<p>If we surrender our individuality to form a faceless regime, how are we better? You're the worst.</p>
<p>Okay, she is just saying that to fit in.</p>
<p>The floor recognizes Magnitude.</p>
<p>First off: Pop, pop! I love it.</p>
<p>Second, Magnitude's a one-man party.</p>
<p>A one-man party can't be in an alliance.</p>
<p>That's a paradox.</p>
<p>I agree to disagree.</p>
<p>Paradox, we're on the same side.</p>
<p>Hasn't the other side already won? Their goal was to make us trash the school.</p>
<p>We trashed it.</p>
<p>We still might hit them where it hurts.</p>
<p>Their balls? No.</p>
<p>Just below their balls? Their wallet, Leonard.</p>
<p>I think it's called a "taint." </p>
<p>Why do you think they sent in a ringer to win? It must be because we're entitled to the prize they promised, a hundred G's.</p>
<p>Ooh, I could use that money.</p>
<p>This is why we have to agree, right now, that whoever wins, we give the money to Greendale.</p>
<p>No! What?! To repair the damage and save our school.</p>
<p>Abed, tell them.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I ain't in it for your revolution.</p>
<p>I'm in it for me.</p>
<p>Wait, Abed, this was your idea.</p>
<p>But I'm calling dibs on the Han Solo role before Jeff slouches into it.</p>
<p>Star-Burns, I need that vest.</p>
<p>Pfft.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Give me the vest, laser breath, before our conversation gets nasty.</p>
<p>Question.</p>
<p>How long is the game gonna last? Andre's home with the baby Shirley, forget your newborn child and think about the people that need you.</p>
<p>I can't afford to lose a single soldier.</p>
<p>What? Oh, now you're the leader? I don't see you stepping up.</p>
<p>I don't step up to being leader.</p>
<p>I reluctantly accept it when it's thrust upon me.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff.</p>
<p>You know, you're an idiot.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What is that? Oh, my God, is he okay? Magnitude.</p>
<p>Pop Po P "Pop?" Pop what? Pop what? What is he trying to say? Pop what, Magnitude?! You sons of bitches.</p>
<p>Can you hear me? Who is this? Oh, that's Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>You are in trouble now.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, it's your friend, the dean.</p>
<p>I'm safe.</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>I can hear you, Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>This is City College's Dean Spreck.</p>
<p>Hey, Spreck, you cheat.</p>
<p>You can't spray people with paint by remote.</p>
<p>And you can't have City College students in a Greendale game.</p>
<p>My men have been registered at Greendale for weeks.</p>
<p>As for rules, they're clearly defined in your school's agreement with my fake ice-cream company.</p>
<p>If you get paint on you, you're out.</p>
<p>I'm glad to see there's paperwork, because we are going to win, and you are gonna pay.</p>
<p>Yay! Go, Jeff Winger's study group.</p>
<p>Those guys are ballers, yo.</p>
<p>I hope you like getting balled.</p>
<p>Sir, this guy tried to charge us three paintballs to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>We were gonna shoot him, but tell him what you told us.</p>
<p>Don't shoot me.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Now shoot him.</p>
<p>Sure, shoot me.</p>
<p>You'd certainly be doing Jeff Winger a big favor.</p>
<p>Greendale Human Beings, it is now clear that we have no choice but to team up and defeat City College.</p>
<p>I also have no choice but to accept the role thrust upon me.</p>
<p>And what role would that be? No time to squabble, Troy.</p>
<p>"For Greendale," on three.</p>
<p>One, two Jeff, every second counts.</p>
<p>"For Greendale," on two.</p>
<p>One Guys.</p>
<p>For Greendale! - For Greendale! Greendale students, I understand you've unified and intend to draw this game out.</p>
<p>Well, if it's a war you want, it's a war you will lose.</p>
<p>City College is stronger, faster.</p>
<p>Our sperm counts are higher, even in our women.</p>
<p>Resistance is as pointless as your degrees.</p>
<p>Honestly, ask yourself, what does "liberal arts" even mean?</p>
<p>"Welcome to Greendale. You're already accepted."</p>
<p>Ha. Losers.</p>
<p>What the hell? Welcome to Greendale.</p>
<p>You're already dead.</p>
<p>Jackpot.</p>
<p>Shirley, you keep watch while we get these.</p>
<p>Here, help me with this.</p>
<p>Sure thing, your worship.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Stop trying to be Han Solo, it's making me embarrassed for you.</p>
<p>Come on, admit it, you like it.</p>
<p>I like having conversations with adults.</p>
<p>Playing Star Wars is worn out and immature.</p>
<p>You like me because I'm immature.</p>
<p>There's not enough immaturity in your life.</p>
<p>I hope I don't get shot waiting out here.</p>
<p>I'd hate to go home to my babies.</p>
<p>Reconnaissance indicates the key to City College's strategy is the Gatling gun inside the ice-cream truck, which we'll charge en masse, overwhelming their defenses, and taking that gun for ourselves.</p>
<p>Well, that's not how I would proceed.</p>
<p>Do you happen to have a better plan? I do happen, Jeff.</p>
<p>I happen very much.</p>
<p>We use sneak attacks to draw their patrols to the library, where one of us will pull the fire alarm, activating the sprinklers, which I will have rigged, to shower everything in the building with paint.</p>
<p>Paint in sprinklers? Are we the Little Rascals? I was.</p>
<p>Have you heard your plan? You wanna charge a machine gun.</p>
<p>I've got something to say.</p>
<p>I don't take orders from girls, because they don't talk to me.</p>
<p>Watch it, quasar face.</p>
<p>Annie's a good kid and a better shot.</p>
<p>So listen up or you'll be floating home.</p>
<p>Thank you, Abed.</p>
<p>Sorry, "Han."</p>
<p>Okay, I think we should split the troops in half and carry out both plans simultaneously.</p>
<p>Troy, your plan will lure people off the ice cream truck, allowing Jeff's troops to take the stronghold.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>I'm so glad that we didn't shoot you.</p>
<p>Now we have the advantage of knowing that Jeff Winger wants to be a ballerina and that his Achilles heel is "wieners." </p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>For one more pudding, I'll tell you why he's jealous of me.</p>
<p>They kicked you out of study group after two years? Yeah.</p>
<p>What took them so long? Hey, thanks for sticking up for me back there.</p>
<p>This group gets so tangled in each others' feelings.</p>
<p>You're a hero for standing outside of it.</p>
<p>Heroes are great, but I'll take a blaster every time.</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to let you know, I don't think you're immature.</p>
<p>I think you're great, for a no-good, laser-faced, Jabba scoundrel.</p>
<p>You're good, kid.</p>
<p>Don't get cocky.</p>
<p>Hey! - Ow! Ow! Damn, my leg.</p>
<p>Take cover.</p>
<p>They're right on our tail.</p>
<p>Operation Troy's Awesome Plan is living up to its name.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Looks like they're taking Troy's bait.</p>
<p>Squad B commencing Operation Actual Operation.</p>
<p>Everyone look alive.</p>
<p>Leonard, good enough.</p>
<p>Greendale, it's been a pleasure fighting with you.</p>
<p>Some of us won't make it, but there is a place where we will see each other again, and that place is Denny's.</p>
<p>Which Denny's? We'll figure it out later.</p>
<p>The one near the 15 exit, I'm banned.</p>
<p>Then I'll see you in hell.</p>
<p>Let's kick some taint.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>On my count.</p>
<p>One, two Vicki! - Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Lock the doors.</p>
<p>Seal the room.</p>
<p>All right, Shirley, you have the most important job, okay? Yeah, pull the fire alarm.</p>
<p>Can we move this along? I'm missing CSI.</p>
<p>Enemy soldiers are incoming.</p>
<p>Everyone evacuate through the air ve - Garrett.</p>
<p>I may be stuck in this vent.</p>
<p>It is too early to tell.</p>
<p>They're all over the place.</p>
<p>They're all over the place.</p>
<p>I think our only choice is to try and shoot our way out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Commence Operation Troy's Awesome Leadership is Never in Doubt.</p>
<p>Ugh! That's affirmative.</p>
<p>That gun's too powerful.</p>
<p>I'm scared.</p>
<p>Hey, Quendra with a "Q-U," they can kill most of us, but as long as nobody gives up, somebody will make it through.</p>
<p>Understand? Yes.</p>
<p>Charge! Well, I'm out.</p>
<p>We lost.</p>
<p>See you at Denny's? Denny's is for winners.</p>
<p>We've got two Human Beings trapped outside of the library.</p>
<p>Keep them pinned down.</p>
<p>It won't be long now.</p>
<p>Leonard, we're losing.</p>
<p>Britta, I've been in a few real wars, but this one is actually the most terrifying.</p>
<p>Guys, we're dying out here.</p>
<p>Well, we're dying too.</p>
<p>They've trapped us in a dead end.</p>
<p>Hey, kid.</p>
<p>Someone's gotta make it out of here alive.</p>
<p>We're taking fire.</p>
<p>We're pulling back.</p>
<p>Pulling back.</p>
<p>Fall back to placement positions.</p>
<p>We're gonna need help.</p>
<p>I had a dream it would end this way.</p>
<p>Take him.</p>
<p>Shirley, nobody's making it out of the library.</p>
<p>Pull the alarm.</p>
<p>Britta, are you alive? Britta? Britta? Aw, hell.</p>
<p>Someone's gotta win this.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I'm eliminated.</p>
<p>I'm out.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Alpha 17, move in.</p>
<p>Looks like this is it.</p>
<p>Will you be Han Solo after we die? Afraid not, doll.</p>
<p>Once I'm gone, I'm gone.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ugh, gotta do everything myself.</p>
<p>We're all dead.</p>
<p>All of us.</p>
<p> Paint is raining from the sky.</p>
<p>Everyone in the library is dead.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Kill him.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Unh It's my heart.</p>
<p>Buddy, you okay? Cool.</p>
<p>Hoo.</p>
<p>Eat paint, you Stormtrooping, City College knob gobblers.</p>
<p>Codger down.</p>
<p>You're it, kid.</p>
<p>Covering the right flank.</p>
<p>Okay, looks like we got her.</p>
<p>Shirley.</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do? How about we save this school's ass? Deal.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on! - Unh! - Yeah! - You'd better watch it.</p>
<p>Oh! Aw.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>I think that's it.</p>
<p>Is that it? We win.</p>
<p>We won! Oh! We win.</p>
<p>We win! Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Unh! - We win.</p>
<p>We win.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>What? All right.</p>
<p>Way to shoot.</p>
<p>All right, we did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, way to go.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Who are you? Your mother's lover.</p>
<p>Unh! - What? - What? - That's low.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I win.</p>
<p>All right! - All right! You owe me a hundred G's.</p>
<p>And you can make the check out to Greendale.</p>
<p>Human Beings! Human Beings! Human Beings! Human Beings! Human Beings! Human Beings! - Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, that's very good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It's nice.</p>
<p>Final meeting of the semester now in session.</p>
<p>Final order of business, pick a class we can all take in the fall.</p>
<p>We could just take Anthro 201.</p>
<p>Risky.</p>
<p>Sequels are almost always disappointing.</p>
<p>Since when are you in favor of playing it safe, Han? Cool down, Annie.</p>
<p>I was only Han Solo because the context demanded it.</p>
<p>But here.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Star-Burns.</p>
<p>He uses a crystal instead of deodorant.</p>
<p>Guys, I know exactly what we should do.</p>
<p>We should see what Troy thinks we should do.</p>
<p>He had some good ideas today.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided we should sleep on it.</p>
<p>Just came back for my day planner.</p>
<p>Pretend I'm not even here.</p>
<p>You guys are great at that.</p>
<p>Come on, Pierce.</p>
<p>We all know there is no "day planner." </p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>If you'll excuse me, I'm running late to drink a bottle of wine in my bathing suit.</p>
<p>Pierce, wait.</p>
<p>You know I've been coming to this school for 12 years? And I've never been friends with anyone here more than a semester.</p>
<p>Probably for the same reason I've been married seven times.</p>
<p>I guess I assume, eventually, I'll be rejected.</p>
<p>So I, you know, test people, push them, until they prove me right.</p>
<p>It's a sickness.</p>
<p>I admit it.</p>
<p>But this place has always accepted me, sickness and all.</p>
<p>This place accepted all of you, sickness and all.</p>
<p>It's worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Um, I think we have thought about it, Pierce, and you're right.</p>
<p>And we were just picking a class we could all be in this fall.</p>
<p>And we'd love for you to join us.</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>I'm done with you guys.</p>
<p>I like this school, but I'm done with whatever you call this.</p>
<p>Adiós.</p>
<p>He was my ride.</p>
<p>I'm going after him.</p>
<p>No, he's just acting out.</p>
<p>I've seen this behavior before.</p>
<p>In cats.</p>
<p>My cats.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>And now he'll come slinking back in five, four, three, two --</p>
<p></p>
