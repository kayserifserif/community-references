<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Please stay for complimentary saltines and full-price sodas.</p>
<p>But first, The Dulcet Tones of the Bennett boys.</p>
<p># When you were here before #</p>
<p># Couldn't look you in the eye #</p>
<p># You're just like an angel #</p>
<p># Your skin makes me cry #</p>
<p>Bro, free crackers.</p>
<p>Want to spend your life opening lockers? You don't have to raise your voice! I'm going as fast as I can! You float like a feather. Oh, great, now I have these folders to deal with! Et tu, pencil? In a beautiful world, when it rains, it pours.</p>
<p>I wish I was special. Ass Crack Bandit! Let's settle down! Guys, what is known - What's known is that around noon yesterday, an unidentified student dropped a coin in another student's, you know, upper buttock fold.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Gwen Ridley, Greendale Gazette.</p>
<p>Is this the return of the Ass Crack Bandit? Okay, that person, Gwen, if he ever existed, stopped being active over a year ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tim Briggs, Greendale Mirror.</p>
<p>Is it true that after the attack, you received a letter from the Ass Crack Bandit? I never said that, Tim, and when did we split the gazette from the mirror? And how many photographs do you people need? Raul Lopez, Las Noticias Hispanicas De Greendale.</p>
<p>Will this affect soccer? We did, in fact, receive a letter an hour after the incident including details not known to the public about the brand of Garrett's underwear.</p>
<p>Hanes his ways.</p>
<p>"I am the Ass Crack Bandit. Humans make better banks than piggies. Whenever I get more change at the store, I can't wait to drop it down your butts. I think I will go to the bank and get so much change and take all my dollars and make them into change and drop it all down there."</p>
<p>He should be called "the run-on sentence bandit".</p>
<p>From this moment, people, we are at DEFCON 4 if that's the highest DEFCON, and if high DEFCONs are worse than low ones.</p>
<p>Ah, you all remember psychology Professor Duncan.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>Where'd you go? I was taking care of my sick mother.</p>
<p>She's still alive, but I've put in my time.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Oh, Pierce, good for you.</p>
<p>I always thought that hairpiece was a bit cowardly.</p>
<p>Duncan is going to help us work up something called a "profile," so we can root this student out.</p>
<p>For the record, I tried to get something done about this two years ago.</p>
<p>This is not about you, Annie.</p>
<p>This is about the school.</p>
<p>This is the biggest P.R. crisis to hit Greendale since we held that rally protesting the wrong Korea.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, how can you help? I'll take a look at the whole picture, see if any pieces match up.</p>
<p>Double fruit bonus.</p>
<p>Crikey! Kiwi combo, mate.</p>
<p>I took a map of the campus and pinpointed all the locations of the Ass Crack Bandit strikes.</p>
<p>You can't handle the fruit.</p>
<p>During the bandit's most daring spree, he cracked three people in a row.</p>
<p>Today, I sprinted between all three sites.</p>
<p>My quickest time was 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The A.C.B. did it in 10.</p>
<p>So he's got long legs.</p>
<p>I think he has something I don't a shortcut.</p>
<p>The faculty lounge.</p>
<p>You think the bandit's a teacher? The Dean's not gonna help me pursue this.</p>
<p>I need help.</p>
<p>Pineapple penalty, fool! No! Unfair and racist.</p>
<p>Look, no way, Annie.</p>
<p>Look, the faculty already hates me, and the Dean signs my paychecks.</p>
<p>But this is important! I can assure you that's not true.</p>
<p>Fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit! Collect the seeds, sucka! After the tone, please leave a message.</p>
<p>Hey, Abed.</p>
<p>Lab ran late.</p>
<p>What'd Annie get us for dinner? I hope it's not salad again.</p>
<p>I'd rather just stop at the meat store.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Talk to you later.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, hello.</p>
<p>Oh! Will you stop with the cups and the blankets? This is how they comfort victims in movies.</p>
<p>Okay, I am hereby banning change from this campus.</p>
<p>You really think that's an effective well, guess what, your two cents is change, and it's banned.</p>
<p>Got something.</p>
<p>Frankie, somebody get me a bag.</p>
<p>Oh, give me that.</p>
<p>"I hope you enjoyed my work again. You can't stop me, because what are you gonna do, not have butts?" Oof.</p>
<p>Dean, I think it's a teacher.</p>
<p>I beg your what? - I have evidence that shows Yeah, and I have evidence that shows I'm not listening.</p>
<p>Exhibit "A," exhibit "B." </p>
<p>Lalalalalala.</p>
<p>This is never gonna end if you keep choosing politics over justice.</p>
<p>Okay, you want to make trouble? Go to Parker brothers.</p>
<p>You're out.</p>
<p>Take it easy.</p>
<p>Taking it easy is how Troy ended up with a quarter of a buck in his crack.</p>
<p>Annie, nobody's asking you to do this Jeff, come on! You know how this school works.</p>
<p>We do it, or it doesn't get done.</p>
<p>The men on our coins understood that.</p>
<p>Maybe the Ass Crack Bandit's point is that we're letting our values slide.</p>
<p>Or maybe he's a frat boy coming from the laundromat.</p>
<p>The important question is "who cares?" Look, let me know what you need from me on the down low.</p>
<p>Way down low.</p>
<p>And no squealing.</p>
<p>Okay, squeal.</p>
<p>Real Neil here, five days into the return of the Ass Crack Bandit.</p>
<p>It's alive! Since we last spoke, three more victims have caught the quarter, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Safety pants, 100 bucks a pop.</p>
<p>All sandwiches $5.</p>
<p>Sorry, no change.</p>
<p>Blame the bandit.</p>
<p>Here's a song that's been shooting up the request line faster than coins are dropping.</p>
<p># It said quarter to five, but it was quarter to ass #</p>
<p># You thought your plumbing was safe #</p>
<p># But your jeans were half-mast #</p>
<p># Another coin down the drain #</p>
<p># Now, that's some change that won't last #</p>
<p>The nature of the Ass Crack Bandit's crimes would suggest that he's angry or just fell in love.</p>
<p>We know that he hates money or loves it or doesn't care about money and hates butts or loves them.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Abed, you're special.</p>
<p>Can't you just stand at the scene of the crime and see what happened? I see a man Using a social disorder as a procedural device.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, I see another man.</p>
<p>Mildly autistic super detectives everywhere.</p>
<p>Basic cable, broadcast networks.</p>
<p>Pain.</p>
<p>Painful writing.</p>
<p>It hurts.</p>
<p>Okay, ooh la la.</p>
<p>Hickey, what have you got? Heartburn.</p>
<p>It doesn't help me catch criminals.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I didn't want to take drastic measures, but I've cooked up a little something.</p>
<p>Chang? You better put a quarter in that crack, Mr. Bandit.</p>
<p>Professor Hickey.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>Hah! Gotcha! Whoa! Ha, what do you think? I think this is spending too much money on a crime that nets you twenty-five cents a pop.</p>
<p>Ah, no, no.</p>
<p>This was free.</p>
<p>Then I think you just admitted you already owned a fake butt.</p>
<p>"I am the mad hatter, if hats were butts. I am neither left nor right. I am the space between. To me, you're all like ants marching to class, freaks on parade." </p>
<p>I mean, why mix metaphors? Ants don't have butts.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Ants do have butts.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>These are Dave lyrics.</p>
<p>Dave? - Dave Matthews.</p>
<p>Hard-core fans call him Dave.</p>
<p>Oh, excuse me for being alive in the '90s and having two ears connected to a heart.</p>
<p>Okay, so all we need to do is assemble a list of which Greendale teachers are Dave Matthews fans.</p>
<p>Guess we better get to work.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thought that would take longer.</p>
<p>So please approve the Dean's new security measure called "Troy's law," because a camera in the bathroom Is better than a quarter in your butt.</p>
<p>As we've seen, the Ass Crack Bandit can be defeated by using the three "B"s: Belts, briefs, and buddies.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>The bandit always gets his victims when they're alone.</p>
<p>Bend over with friends over.</p>
<p>There's safety in numbers.</p>
<p>I got cracked! He's under the bleachers! Everyone remain calm, please! All right, free-for-all! Hey.</p>
<p>Where you been? I questioned Guterman.</p>
<p>We can cross him off.</p>
<p>At the time of the first cracking, he was chaperoning Greendale's science dance.</p>
<p>The student that attended can vouch for him.</p>
<p>I checked out Mrs. Plimpton.</p>
<p>Airtight alibi.</p>
<p>She's dead.</p>
<p>Next on my list is this one.</p>
<p>Bublitz.</p>
<p>We're close, I can feel it.</p>
<p>Mmm! This extra long churro tastes good in my real mouth.</p>
<p>Nom nom nom nom nom.</p>
<p>May I help you? We'd like to ask you a few questions if that's okay.</p>
<p>He's bolting! He's there! If you're going to confiscate this, know one thing.</p>
<p>It's a mild, kind sativa, perfect for playing guitar.</p>
<p>There's been another what the hell? Destroying classrooms? Secretly investigating teachers behind my back? Someone has to investigate the faculty, but you're like a single-celled organism no nerve.</p>
<p>Annie, you're suspended.</p>
<p>Wait, you can't do that! Don't tell me what I can't do.</p>
<p>What do you think you are, Cosmo's July quiz? She was trying to help you.</p>
<p>Let me ask you two something.</p>
<p>Let me be, like, the 50th person at this school to ask, what is this, huh? - What is this creepy business? - What? I think you two like to partner up on cutesy capers so you can hold hands in the dark and address your urges in semi-acceptable scenarios.</p>
<p>Whoa, not cool! You not cool! You unprofessional! I'm punishing you, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Starting next week, you are the new coach of the water polo team.</p>
<p>What? - That's right.</p>
<p>Every morning, in the water Mm.</p>
<p>Craig Pelton, Dean and assistant water polo coach.</p>
<p>What? This is the Ass Crack Bandit.</p>
<p>Uh - I find it funny that you ever thought you could catch me.</p>
<p>Oh, that's very interesting.</p>
<p>Please continue.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed our game of cat and mouse.</p>
<p>It's funny how close your two little helpers came to catching me.</p>
<p>I liked watching them run in circles.</p>
<p>Although sometimes I wonder, are they chasing me as an excuse to get near each other? I mean, get a room already.</p>
<p>We're friends! Why don't you tell us where you are, and we'll discuss it? I am the bringer of change.</p>
<p>I am the filler of cracks.</p>
<p>Oh, that's very interesting.</p>
<p>I myself was in 4h.</p>
<p>Oh! Trace the call, Rhonda! This means trace the call! Look at the extension.</p>
<p>Tracing Tracing.</p>
<p>Got it, the stables! We have stables? Let's go.</p>
<p>Creepy.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Add some doilies and a foot bath, and this is my mom's house.</p>
<p>Mush! Mush! Mush! Yah! Mush! No, run.</p>
<p>Mush! Mush! Starburns? Since faking his death to escape meth charges, Alex "Starburns" Osbourne has been living in the stables, eating garbage, and trying to build a cat car.</p>
<p>He's also confessed to dropping coins down exposed butt cracks.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>High five? - Sure.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, American high five.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Whoo! - Oh! - Ooh! So much pain.</p>
<p>But now it's time to heal! You're all invited to the official "we caught the Ass Crack Bandit" dance tonight in the cafeteria! Jeff! There's no way Starburns did it.</p>
<p>Innocent people don't confess.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? You knew it was a teacher.</p>
<p>You know that doesn't add up.</p>
<p>Maybe I was wrong.</p>
<p>Or maybe the Dean was right about us.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Annie, I took this case because I wanted to help you.</p>
<p>Then what is this? It's platonic shoulder holding.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Leonard, hello, how are you? It's a guy who puts quarters down butt cracks, Jeff.</p>
<p>Let's just let it go.</p>
<p>We can do better.</p>
<p>Aah! Change is money! What are you guys, millionaires? T-shirts here! Cracked but not broken, huh? Who's in? T-shirts! T-shirts here! - Professor Duncan? - Yeah? - Not going to the dance? - I'll go later.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, would you mind coming and getting me when Britta's drunk? Listen, as Britta's friend, I should give you this ad Yes! That is my jam right there.</p>
<p>Dave Matthews fan? Obviously you're not.</p>
<p>Real fans call him Dave.</p>
<p>Bum bum bum  I've heard this song before.</p>
<p>Hey, winger, who is this? What are you talking about? You don't know who this is? I remember it from the '90s.</p>
<p>Hee haw haw haw hee haw haw  - It's Dave.</p>
<p>Lee Roth? You're not the Ass Crack Bandit.</p>
<p>Shh! Keep it down, huh? I made a deal with the Dean.</p>
<p>He said as long as I confessed, he'd let me slide on the meth stuff, and then he'd buy me a space heater for my stable.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why call the Dean and pretend that I didn't call no Dean.</p>
<p>I don't call nobody don't call me.</p>
<p>I got to go backstage once and meet the whole band, everyone Except Dave.</p>
<p>There's a whole album of photos online if you go to you actually wouldn't be able to access it.</p>
<p>I use an older, British form of Facebook called "mug-scroll." </p>
<p>I guess I should be going.</p>
<p>No, no, stay.</p>
<p>We're just getting to know each other.</p>
<p>I really shouldn't, I have a Oopsie.</p>
<p>Aren't you going to pick those up? Yes.</p>
<p>Just -- Reach down with your hand and -- Bye.</p>
<p>This is the Ass Crack Bandit.</p>
<p>I find it funny that you ever thought you could catch me.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>It's Duncan.</p>
<p>Annie? Jeff? Very nice.</p>
<p>Oh, bloody hell, my shoe is untied by British standards.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>One bunny, two bunnies.</p>
<p>Oh! Get Britta! Annie! Did Duncan get cracked? Where's the bandit? Do you see him? - Over there! - Come on, let's get him! Shirley, what are you doing? Looking for you.</p>
<p>Did you see someone come this way? Jeff, Annie, Pierce is dead.</p>
<p>Tonight's celebration was cut short by some tragic news.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne, entrepreneur, and expert heart attack faker has passed away, for real this time.</p>
<p>Pierce had been recently banned from campus, but not from our hearts.</p>
<p>He's survived by many ex-wives and all of us here at Greendale that called him friend.</p>
<p>If you're listening, Pierce, you were a hell of a d&d player.</p>
<p>It's time to level up.</p>
<p>Up next on the dial is Dr. Farts.</p>
<p>I can't believe Pierce is gone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Life is weird.</p>
<p>It's a container for all this little stuff, and you get caught up in it.</p>
<p>And then, the container just Pbbt.</p>
<p>That hallway led to a dead end.</p>
<p>We might've had him.</p>
<p>I should get home.</p>
<p>Haven't slept.</p>
<p>The case goes cold again.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>I got a feeling he'll be back.</p>
<p>Or her.</p>
<p># Ah ah ah ah #</p>
<p># Twenty-five cents at a time he's taking our souls #</p>
<p># Government men can't help, we're all alone #</p>
<p># Are you feeling the breeze? #</p>
<p># Did you pull your belt tight? #</p>
<p># You know that it's wrong, you know that it's right #</p>
<p># Out of the shadows down the coin goes #</p>
<p># Why, oh, why do you suppose? #</p>
<p># Only the bandit knows #</p>
<p># Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh #</p>
<p># Ass c-r-a-c-k bandit #</p>
<p># Whoa oh oh oh #</p>
<p># Oh whoa oh oh oh #</p>
<p># Ass c-r-a-c-k can't stand it #</p>
