<div id='transcript'>
<p>Good morning, Greendale.</p>
<p>As you know, it is April Fools' Day.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>It's the day before April Fools.</p>
<p>See what I did there?</p>
<p>Baba booey, baba booey, baba booey --</p>
<p>You know what, Leonard? Strike two.</p>
<p>Anyway, just reminding you to keep any April Fools pranks physically safe, politically balanced and racially accessible.</p>
<p>When in doubt, check the guidelines in our college pranks literature.</p>
<p>Guidelines for school-sanctioned pranks.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Reminds me of my favorite college comedy.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, which one? Exactly.</p>
<p>See, the dean doesn't get it.</p>
<p>The point of a practical joke is to shake up the system.</p>
<p>For example, who wants some of these? Cool, yeah.</p>
<p>Looking for something? Nice.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>They allow volunteers for campus security during times of heightened shenanigans.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I wanna be security.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Let's do it together.</p>
<p>We can be partners.</p>
<p>That's a buddy cop movie I would watch.</p>
<p>But I wonder, Which of you would be by the book? Which of you would be the badass? Oh, Abed, you're so silly.</p>
<p>I would be the badass.</p>
<p>Greetings, mortals.</p>
<p>Morning.</p>
<p>Snake in a can? Uh, no, thanks.</p>
<p>I'm fasting.</p>
<p>My Buddhist church is having its annual ascension ceremony, and I will be becoming a level-six laser lotus.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I was speechless too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have to detoxify for the ceremony.</p>
<p>I get all the nutrients I need with saltwater and honey.</p>
<p>It's better if it goes down the wrong pipe.</p>
<p>So, what happens in level six? Well, nobody in my hive has ever seen a six, but, uh, from what I hear, I'll have immunity to germs, a heightened psychic ability and improved night vision.</p>
<p>Any bonuses to your combat score? I assume I'll fight better if I can see more, heh, dumb-ass.</p>
<p>Hey, Pierce, I just remembered.</p>
<p>Right before you got here, some guy was delivering level-six ceremonial robes? What? Why didn't you tell me? Maybe if you run you can catch him.</p>
<p>Way to use your brain, Winger.</p>
<p>Abed, how fast can you run to the Theater Department? Thirty-seven seconds.</p>
<p>Don't come back without something ridiculous.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Guys, you realize you're exploiting the naiveté of a man who is being brainwashed by a cult.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds a lot less fun when you say it.</p>
<p>Everything does.</p>
<p>She's a buzz kill.</p>
<p>I'm not a buzz kill.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, that doesn't really describe it.</p>
<p>You're more of a fun-vampire, because you don't suck blood, you just suck.</p>
<p>He wasn't there.</p>
<p>Oh, I think Abed found him.</p>
<p>Hey, give me.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It is absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>How do I look? May I? Yeah.</p>
<p>Magical.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Of course, the only one who doesn't like this is Britta.</p>
<p>You ever get tired of being a buzz kill? This is gonna be exciting, ladies.</p>
<p>I hereby deputize you as campus security for 48 hours.</p>
<p>Your windbreakers.</p>
<p>Your whistles.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Now I only have the one pepper spray.</p>
<p>It's mine.</p>
<p>But I'll just get my groceries in a better neighborhood this week.</p>
<p>I'll carry it.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Between the two of us, I'm sort of the badass.</p>
<p>You are? Uh, h--how do you figure? I don't know, Shirley.</p>
<p>How did you figure I wasn't? I guess I didn't figure because I was too busy being the obvious badass.</p>
<p>Sounds like we're both pretty convinced.</p>
<p>I guess we'll find out once we're on the job.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I guess we will.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, what is going on here? A twist on a classic formula.</p>
<p>Normally, with buddy cops, one's a straight-laced stickler, the other's a renegade.</p>
<p>But these two have equal claim to both roles.</p>
<p>And why are you here? Short answer? My cable went out.</p>
<p>Hey, can I run something by you? I was thinking of pulling a little prank tonight.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>April Fools prank.</p>
<p>So you know how they have live frogs in the anatomy lab? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So I was gonna sneak in there, get a frog, and then tomorrow when Señor Chang's class is coming in, there will be a frog on his desk wearing Tada.</p>
<p>Oh, you're done.</p>
<p>Did you read the hat? "Señor Chang." </p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you don't get it.</p>
<p>I guess I don't.</p>
<p>The frog is Chang.</p>
<p>Okay, I did get it.</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>I know it's funny.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, I forgot.</p>
<p>It's not your kind of joke.</p>
<p>It's not at anyone's expense.</p>
<p>Britta, why waste your time envying my gift for levity? When there's so much you could be doing with your natural talent for severity.</p>
<p>You know what? My prank is gonna cause a sea of laughter, and I'm gonna watch you drown in it.</p>
<p>Thattagirl.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Jeff, I can read minds.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>What color am I thinking of? Pink.</p>
<p>What the hey? Must be the robe.</p>
<p>Hey, Cookie Crisp.</p>
<p>Cookie Crisp.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is he talking to me? No, no.</p>
<p>Hey, Pierce, that guy came back that brought your robes and said he forgot to deliver this.</p>
<p>What is it? He said it focuses your powers? Is that a cookie? Oh! Maybe it's a piece of meteor.</p>
<p>Buddha arrived on a meteor.</p>
<p>When's the last time he ate? I am the coolest guy in the world.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Frog.</p>
<p>Can I just borrow you for a second? I'm Señor Chang.</p>
<p>Now tell me that's not funny.</p>
<p>Aah! Oh! Oh, no.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Here, froggy, froggy, froggy.</p>
<p>Here frog, frog, froggy.</p>
<p>Mr. Frog? Real quiet.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Uhn! Yaah! Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Aah! Call the ambulance! It's so horrible.</p>
<p>It's a dead body.</p>
<p>And what makes it worse is this was a brand new sign, so I just don't want this to tarnish our school's reputation.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Your school's reputation is way worse than this.</p>
<p>Oh, here's our campus security.</p>
<p>Just stop right there.</p>
<p>Oh, ladies, don't pull up on the Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>Morning, boys.</p>
<p>I'm Annie Edison.</p>
<p>But people call me Psycho because I had a nervous breakdown in high school.</p>
<p>My partner is a Christian housewife.</p>
<p>Can we help you? Actually, can we not help you? I tend to play by my own rules.</p>
<p>She loves rules.</p>
<p>I only have one.</p>
<p>Stay out of my way.</p>
<p>Stay out of mine more.</p>
<p>You know what? This is misdemeanor vandalism.</p>
<p>You ladies can take care of it yourselves.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>What? Call us when you find a perp.</p>
<p>Yeah, heh, we'll be waiting.</p>
<p>Oh, you go.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm about to.</p>
<p>Now look what you have done.</p>
<p>Tell them they got 24 hours to solve the case.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>You have 24 hours to solve it or else.</p>
<p>Figure it out.</p>
<p>That's the poster.</p>
<p>So this is the part of my job that I enjoy the least.</p>
<p>The part where I inform you that last night, someone murdered a partially clothed animal and threw a human corpse out a window.</p>
<p>And you can thank the person that did it, a person that may be in this room, for the fact that from now on, April Fools' Day is banished, okay? At Greendale, April 1st is officially March 32nd forever.</p>
<p>How do you know it was one of us? Well, if I may answer a question with a question, why are you dressed like a wizard? Okay, is he having a stroke? I'll tell you how I know.</p>
<p>Security Officers Bennett and Edison found this at the scene.</p>
<p>Hmm? The little hat says "Chang" on it.</p>
<p>And we ruled out your teacher because he has a crippling fear of frogs.</p>
<p>I told you that in confidence.</p>
<p>How about whoever did this just fesses up? All right, that wasn't just a cadaver that was thrown out that window.</p>
<p>It was a person with family and friends.</p>
<p>And for every day that nobody confesses, this class will be meeting one of them.</p>
<p>Hmm? Glenda? Oh, I apologize.</p>
<p>Can you come on in here.</p>
<p>Hmm? Yes.</p>
<p>And tell us about your son.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Harry was a wonderful man.</p>
<p>He kept a dream journal.</p>
<p>Page one.</p>
<p>"I had that dream again where I'm in a forest but the trees are pencils." </p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Impressive.</p>
<p>And hilarious.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You gonna fess up, weirdo? Look, it wasn't me.</p>
<p>Even if it was, this was an accident.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Nicely done.</p>
<p>If I come forward, it's gonna play into the "Britta's a buzz kill" mythology.</p>
<p>Well, the toe tag fits, Britta.</p>
<p>I mean, you single-handedly killed an entire school's buzz, not to mention a frog.</p>
<p>According to Glenda, cadaver Harry had that I'm not interested in meeting.</p>
<p>So you better think about coming clean, or I'm just gonna tell everybody you did it.</p>
<p>Star-Burns doesn't do very much.</p>
<p>I guess fascinating people don't resort to growing shapes on their faces.</p>
<p>He makes one false move, and I'm gonna go Shirley on him.</p>
<p>That's what my high school friends called crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah? You gonna go Shirlier than I did when I got addicted to pills? Why are you so concerned with being badass? Maybe I'm tired of everyone thinking of me as a little girl.</p>
<p>Maybe I wanna be in charge of how I'm defined.</p>
<p>Well, how do you think I feel? You have two kids, and they stick you in the margins.</p>
<p>I'm not done yet.</p>
<p>I still got moves.</p>
<p>I haven't even started yet.</p>
<p>I've got moves I haven't even seen before.</p>
<p>Blocked call.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Edison.</p>
<p>The man you're looking for is Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Who is this? I didn't recognize the voice.</p>
<p>They say Jeff Winger's our man.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Drop them if you smoke them.</p>
<p>Cut to action sequence.</p>
<p>Let's roll.</p>
<p>Security's coming through.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>Cagney, Lacey.</p>
<p>What can I do you for? Just doing a routine search.</p>
<p>What is this? What do you have here? That's my chest.</p>
<p>Why don't you spread them? Huh? What are you packing here? Guys.</p>
<p>I can pat.</p>
<p>I can do it too.</p>
<p>So, uh, what have you got in the bag? Yeah.</p>
<p>What the? Hey.</p>
<p>Let's see what we have here.</p>
<p>Holy Mary, mother of pearl.</p>
<p>What do we have here, huh? Looks like enough tiny items to equip an amphibious mariachi band.</p>
<p>Of frogs.</p>
<p>That is not my stuff.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Britta planted that.</p>
<p>Sure she did.</p>
<p>Tell that to what our equivalent of a judge is.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>What is? He's getting away.</p>
<p>Go, go.</p>
<p>Drive.</p>
<p>When you turn to yell at me He's right there.</p>
<p>Okay, hold it What are these doing here? He's getting away.</p>
<p>Go after him on foot.</p>
<p>I'm going after him on foot.</p>
<p>Cut him off on the other side.</p>
<p>I'm cutting him off on the other side.</p>
<p>Stop or I'll shoot.</p>
<p>I said, stop.</p>
<p>Oh, God, no.</p>
<p>Aah! Aah! It burns.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Oh, great, he got away.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>He got away because of your driving, Grandma.</p>
<p>Oh, I beg your pardon, <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hannah Montana</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493093'>Hannah Montana</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>2006&ndash;2011</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Family</span><span class='tag genre'>Music</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Are you hard of hearing? You know what? This is why you have hardly any friends.</p>
<p>Looks like I have one less now.</p>
<p>Do I look like I'm crying? These are not tears.</p>
<p>This is self-inflicted friendly fire, okay? That's what happens to children.</p>
<p>You have no idea what I've been through! You don't think I've got the strength for this! Excuse me.</p>
<p>I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I'll give you the rest of these chocolate-covered raisins if you save my seat.</p>
<p>To be alone out there.</p>
<p>You are assuming I don't want you to feel judged by this, but your handling of this job has disappointed me.</p>
<p>I mean, your high-speed pursuit caused $ 78 worth of damages.</p>
<p>And you didn't even get a statement out of Mr. Winger? He got away.</p>
<p>He ran between two poles.</p>
<p>Well, I see how that would be frustrating but the fact is, Your ass is on the line.</p>
<p>My ass is on the line.</p>
<p>You just got off the phone with the mayor.</p>
<p>I just got off the phone What? The mayor? Stop doing that.</p>
<p>I'm trying to help.</p>
<p>You're not doing this right.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you should do it.</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of making excuses for you two.</p>
<p>You're an embarrassment to the department.</p>
<p>You're off the case and off the force.</p>
<p>Your badges, your windbreakers now.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>I ain't got all day.</p>
<p>Agitating my sciatica.</p>
<p>I'm too old for this.</p>
<p>Now get out of my sight.</p>
<p>Thought you were badasses, huh? Real badasses work together.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>All I see is a housewife and girl scout.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>I said, get out.</p>
<p>And don't even think about getting near this case.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Pretty harsh.</p>
<p>Don't worry, that's what they needed.</p>
<p>Well, that was embarrassing.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>That African-American police chief character Abed was playing was right.</p>
<p>We should have worked as a team.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, I don't need a badge to finish this.</p>
<p>I say we nail Winger to the wall.</p>
<p>Together? Together.</p>
<p>How do you spell "testicles"? Nice frame job, Britta-dict Arnold.</p>
<p>Oh, colonial burn.</p>
<p>Come on, Jeff, where's that trademark gift for levity? Well, well, well, look who we found.</p>
<p>Yes, how foolish of me to hide in my regularly scheduled study group.</p>
<p>Jeff, ahem, let's just do this the easy way.</p>
<p>Confess.</p>
<p>Britta's the one who threw that body out the window.</p>
<p>And I can prove it.</p>
<p>How? Britta was going to put a frog wearing a sombrero on Chang's desk because that's the kind of thing she thinks is funny.</p>
<p>Don't you, Britta? No.</p>
<p>Then why is there a photo on your Facebook page of a cat wearing a necktie? Pfft.</p>
<p>This is my cat.</p>
<p>And the tie makes him? Formal.</p>
<p>This investigation is going nowhere.</p>
<p>You need a psychic.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>This process may alarm you.</p>
<p>Oh! Gay, gay, gay.</p>
<p>So gay.</p>
<p>Oh-oh.</p>
<p>Dark nightclub.</p>
<p>Aah, aah.</p>
<p>Throbbing music.</p>
<p>Men's room Men's room stall.</p>
<p>Penis.</p>
<p>Two penises.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So gay.</p>
<p>He's so gay.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>What? Sit down.</p>
<p>We'll take it from here.</p>
<p>Uhn.</p>
<p>Jeff, where were you last night? At a bar.</p>
<p>Called it.</p>
<p>Who can confirm that? Your mama? What? While I'm -- oh! Oh! What the hell, Annie? Her name's not Annie, it's Psycho.</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd tell her what she wants to hear.</p>
<p>That's right, because if I have to hand you off to Shirley, you're gonna enter a kitchen of pain.</p>
<p>Uhn! Guys, stop it.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I framed Jeff.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Jeff.</p>
<p>But why? Because I'm a buzz kill, that's why.</p>
<p>Because that's who I am.</p>
<p>That's my role.</p>
<p>You guys, you create fun, and I destroy it.</p>
<p>Of course a silly little joke ends with a dead body on the lawn.</p>
<p>I should have known that but I wanted to do it anyway.</p>
<p>I wanted to be like you.</p>
<p>I wanted to be funny.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>Who's there? Cancer.</p>
<p>Oh, good, come on in.</p>
<p>I thought it was Britta.</p>
<p>Well, Britta, I actually wanna be taken more seriously.</p>
<p>And the only reason I slammed Jeff's head against the table was because I wanted to feel like an adult.</p>
<p>Like Shirley.</p>
<p>And I wanted to feel younger like Annie.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm really old because people don't know how young I really am.</p>
<p>See? I'm doing it again.</p>
<p>I hate that I obsess about my age.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>I wish I was really magic.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>You know you're not? Yeah.</p>
<p>Hah.</p>
<p>Somebody must have sent these robes by accident.</p>
<p>I only pretended I was level six to impress you guys.</p>
<p>I got held back.</p>
<p>I don't even deserve this Buddhist meteor wand.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It's not a meteor.</p>
<p>It's a cookie wand.</p>
<p>Me and Jeff made it because it made you look like the Cookie Crisp wizard.</p>
<p>Which is not even a reference I get because the Cookie Crisp mascot wasn't a wizard when I was a kid, it was a burglar.</p>
<p>I just pretended like I knew because I wanted Jeff to think I was smart.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I did it again.</p>
<p>I killed the buzz.</p>
<p>Look, um, maybe, maybe "buzz kill" is a bad choice of words.</p>
<p>What's a good choice of words? I don't know.</p>
<p>I, um, I, you're, you're like the dark cloud that unites us.</p>
<p>Or the the anti-Winger.</p>
<p>You're like, you're, you're the heart of this group.</p>
<p>Uh, look, um, I don't have a real handle on all this mushy stuff.</p>
<p>If, if I did, then we wouldn't need you.</p>
<p>Britta, get over here.</p>
<p>Really? Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's never let Jeff divide us again.</p>
<p>Hey, Abed.</p>
<p>Why are you and I the only sane? Shh.</p>
<p>Just watch.</p>
<p>It's beautiful.</p>
<p>Troy, do you want a bite of my wand? I do.</p>
<p>We really appreciate you doing this.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And three, two, one.</p>
<p># Troy and Abed in the morning #</p>
<p>And we're back.</p>
<p>Look who's here, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Jeff, how do you stay so fit? Uh, diet, exercise, genetics.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it seems we have a clip.</p>
<p>You wanna set up for us? Uh, I'd like to but I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Okay, we'll just roll it.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>My name's Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I'm Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>I'm so tall.</p>
<p>This watch is expensive.</p>
<p>Muscles are everywhere.</p>
<p>That was funny.</p>
<p>What's going on? Where are the cameras? We're not filming this.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Who'd wanna watch this? Guys, it's 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>We're not gonna have him back.</p>
<p># Troy and Abed in the morn-- #</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p></p>
