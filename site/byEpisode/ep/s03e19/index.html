<p>Look at us.</p>
<p>Still together as a group even, what, two months after being kicked out of you know where.</p>
<p>Yeah, good thing I came up with this idea for potluck dinners.</p>
<p>Pierce, all you said was, "I'm hungry." </p>
<p>All Henry Ford said was, "I need a ride." </p>
<p>Troy, is that a casserole? It's bagel bites in a deconstructed hot pocket reduction with a doritos glaze.</p>
<p>I just really want to make my food, you know.</p>
<p>Did anybody bring anything that isn't poison? I need to eat natural, organic foods, or I'm never gonna get rid of this hangover.</p>
<p>Jeff, what'd you bring? Pack of lifesavers.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Dead battery.</p>
<p>Where's Abed? Have you seen Abed? He's probably out getting something really cool for the dinner.</p>
<p>See? Cool.</p>
<p>Abed brought delicious police.</p>
<p>Abed, what happened? Found your friend going through the dumpster outside the administration building in Greendale again.</p>
<p>This cadet could use a lesson in intergalactic protocol.</p>
<p>It's okay, officer.</p>
<p>He's just playing a character from TV.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I'm very familiar with Inspector Spacetime.</p>
<p>You think a guy becomes a cop because his prom night was a dream? If this were comic-con, I'd take a bullet for that kid.</p>
<p>But, here in the real world, trespassing is a crime.</p>
<p>We're sorry, officer.</p>
<p>Our friend has been having a hard time adjusting to being expelled from Greendale.</p>
<p>It won't happen again.</p>
<p>That's for sure.</p>
<p>I talked to your former Dean.</p>
<p>I recommended he press charges.</p>
<p>He said he'd hold off on the condition that you set an appointment with this guy.</p>
<p>He's offering to foot the bill for the consultation himself.</p>
<p>It's the number for a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Abed's not crazy.</p>
<p>Where does the Dean get off? He's not the real Dean.</p>
<p>He's been replaced by an identical life-form for some nefarious purpose.</p>
<p>Reggie, to the time booth.</p>
<p>We haven't much space.</p>
<p>I'll be right there, inspector.</p>
<p>Hey, before I go, you really shouldn't be using this to prop open your building's door.</p>
<p>This is an antique fire brick.</p>
<p>I'd say pre-civil war.</p>
<p>Note the uneven orange hue and the embossment on the back.</p>
<p>What a nifty little piece of americana.</p>
<p>You could get 50, 60 bucks for it from the right collector.</p>
<p>I watch a lot of antiques roadshow.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Anyway, walk to your cars in pairs tonight.</p>
<p>Rape's up 8%.</p>
<p>$60? Hello? Rich people, Troy's joining you.</p>
<p>Yes, I'll hold.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>I'm Dr. Heidi.</p>
<p>We're going to have a little chat tonight, you and I.</p>
<p>How does that sound? I don't need therapy.</p>
<p>Well, that's a perfectly normal response.</p>
<p>I concur with Dr. Heidi's diagnosis.</p>
<p>I haven't diagnosed anything yet.</p>
<p>Psych major.</p>
<p>Got your back, brah.</p>
<p>I have to say, I didn't expect to see so many of you.</p>
<p>Abed won't go to any kind of doctor on his own.</p>
<p>We caught him last year trying to remove his own tonsils.</p>
<p>Well, why don't you let me take it from here? You have to understand about Abed.</p>
<p>He's usually, you know, adorable weird, like Mork from Ork, but, since we got expelled, he's been creepy weird, like present-day <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Robin Williams</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245'>Robin Williams</a></span><span class='years'>1951&ndash;2014</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>writer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093105'>tt0093105</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107614'>tt0107614</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265459'>tt0265459</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217'>tt0119217</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>I'm not crazy.</p>
<p>Well, Abed, I don't deal in crazy.</p>
<p>I deal in health.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So how long has Abed needed a crazy amount of help? All of this behavior started after you were expelled? There may have been a ramp-up.</p>
<p>It's okay, buddy.</p>
<p>Just a few more minutes, and we're good until spring, okay? But it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>We get the hour back later in the year.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I "Rent Tower Heist" last night, and I won't spoil the ending, but let me tell you, it was quite the hilarious Thrill Ride.</p>
<p>That Brett Ratner, he's a master at comedic action-adventure.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>A master at storytelling.</p>
<p>He's just a master at making movies in general.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it.</p>
<p>He's the new Spielberg.</p>
<p>Oh! I have to go.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You're a bad person.</p>
<p>You're a bad person.</p>
<p>Time enough at last to eat a sandwich.</p>
<p>Though even he knew that this sandwich was nearer his last sandwich than his first.</p>
<p>Abed, I'm trying to eat.</p>
<p>He said, oldly, his brittle bones straining to support the weight of his wrinkly skin.</p>
<p>Stop narrating me.</p>
<p>He shouted to no one, just a man alone in time with nothing but the cold squishiness of tuna salad to comfort him.</p>
<p>I take it back.</p>
<p>I don't want to be in your novel.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne had nearly lost his grip on reality.</p>
<p>Lately, he'd begun to think he was in a novel.</p>
<p>And action.</p>
<p>Abed, what the hell are you doing? Cut.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>One more for safety.</p>
<p>Abed, it's 4:30 in the morning, and you're in my bedroom.</p>
<p>Use that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And action.</p>
<p>But that's almost completely nearly all of it.</p>
<p>If Abed is as sick as you all say, then I have no Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Nobody in this room gets to define sick.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I'm a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Any kind of doctor can really.</p>
<p>Really?—Yes.</p>
<p>Well, if Abed's sick, then we're all sick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can't determine a person's sanity from a few amusing stories.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I mean, if anything, Abed's more sane than any of us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I mean, he's certainly the craziest one of us, but, you know, we're all kind of crazy-town banana pants.</p>
<p>Talk to me about crazy-town banana pants.</p>
<p>Look, we're just saying it's been a crazy year for everybody.</p>
<p>Who among us hasn't had the odd banana in his or her pants, right? I have.</p>
<p>How long does peyote last? Just asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed and Annie in the morning  What are you doing? Nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing my ass.</p>
<p>What are all these cameras doing here? Here, take my coat.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That's so sweet.</p>
<p>Just don't eat anything or drink anything, and no sweating or bending at the elbows, and no chairs with backrests, and if you take it off, wooden hangers only.</p>
<p>You're probably warm now, right? Good news, guys.</p>
<p>I spent all my money.</p>
<p>Troy, you can't bring that in here.</p>
<p>Yes, I can.</p>
<p>It's all-terrain, dummy.</p>
<p>I made a plate of cookies for the study group, but my boys ate them, so since they took something of yours, you all get something of theirs.</p>
<p>Elijah loves this, Britta.</p>
<p>There you go, Jeff.</p>
<p>There you go, Troy.</p>
<p>There you go, Pierce.</p>
<p>Karate championship, second place! Now I'll be unstoppable.</p>
<p>Oyay! So you see what you call insanity we call solidarity.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>We just finished telling him about it, and you grab it and squeeze it?—I said I was sorry.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And so as a group, do you always indulge Abed in these little misadventures? Take that back.</p>
<p>Our adventures are very manly.</p>
<p>I have to say there's more important to mental health than a support system.</p>
<p>And assuming that this group is, for Abed, said support system, I think I've heard everything I need to hear in order to make a decision.</p>
<p>I think that Abed should be committed.</p>
<p>You mean committed to his character work, right? Because he already is.</p>
<p>Abed, show him your Don Draper.</p>
<p>Cigarettes.</p>
<p>No, I mean an institution.</p>
<p>You mean like marriage? I mean a mental institution.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>So do I.</p>
<p>Will someone please help me lighten the mood? Please, Mr. Dr. Psychiatrist, sir, please don't send my best friend to crazy people jail.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>He doesn't have the right.</p>
<p>Abed's not dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's just unique, like a snowflake who gets bent out of shape when you mix up Star Wars and space treks.</p>
<p>Or a serial killer's signature.</p>
<p>I'm a psych major.</p>
<p>His continued obsession with Greendale Community College suggests the potential for escalation.</p>
<p>And, frankly, these stories you've been telling me are very troubling.</p>
<p>You're troubled? I don't remember any of those things happening.</p>
<p>Since when do these three live together? Look, Abed's obsession with Greendale doesn't make him crazy.</p>
<p>If you had gone to school there, you'd be obsessed with it too.</p>
<p>It was a messed-up place.</p>
<p>We had lockers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're survivors.</p>
<p>My name is Pwofussa Wobinswin.</p>
<p>Who's weady to wearn? Dean, this is not the way to agree on parking for the job fair! It's inhumane.</p>
<p>You have a better idea, Britta? Yes.</p>
<p>Thousands of them.</p>
<p>Vicki to Queen 3.</p>
<p>Neigh.</p>
<p>That's all for today.</p>
<p>Read chapter four.</p>
<p>Okay, we're just gonna ignore that.</p>
<p>Bananas?—Yes.</p>
<p>Toast?—Yes.</p>
<p>Bubble gum?—Yes.</p>
<p>Pancakes?—Yes.</p>
<p>Fries?—Get out.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>There's one every year.</p>
<p>I will not tolerate clowning.</p>
<p>Car keys?—Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, last bathroom break.</p>
<p>We've got to cram for Excuse me, sir, can we get to our Slow your bones, Rufus.</p>
<p>We got a long road tomorrow.</p>
<p>Welcome to ladders.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Just wanted to see if we got the same thing.</p>
<p>It sounds as though this Greendale had quite an effect on all of you.</p>
<p>You should all definitely stop dwelling on it if you want to be healthy.</p>
<p>Well, come on, it wasn't all bad.</p>
<p>I was there longer than anybody, and I'm fine.</p>
<p>How are you? Why do you ask? Uh-oh.</p>
<p>What Pierce was saying before he started sundowning is true.</p>
<p>We can't just pass the crazy buck to Greendale.</p>
<p>It could be a good place too.</p>
<p>That really doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a lot of memories of Greendale being in our corner.</p>
<p>Dean-a-ling.</p>
<p>I just wanted to drop by and tell you we ought to be hot-stepping it out to the parking lot in a brisk, but orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Is there a fire drill? No, sir, there's an actual fire.</p>
<p>I wanted you guys to be the first to know before I tell everyone else.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's not right to play favorites, but it is no more right to sit on your feelings, and I don't know what I'd do without you guys.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Okay, fire, fire! There's a fire! Darcy, you've got a cold.</p>
<p>I feel fine.</p>
<p>You're sick.</p>
<p>Go home! Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get out of here! I can't believe we got here too late for pizza.</p>
<p>Worst pizza day ever.</p>
<p>Oh, darn it.</p>
<p>What am I gonna do with all this garbage? Psst, it's me, the Dean.</p>
<p>I pulled the last six pieces of pizza for you.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Back to garbage detail.</p>
<p>We have a few students with birthdays today, but, hey, why single them out? What about the students who aren't celebrating anything at all? Are they any less special?</p>
<p># Troy and Jeffrey #</p>
<p># And Annie and Britta # </p>
<p># And Shirley and Pierce # </p>
<p># And Abed and Jeffrey #</p>
<p># Just a few of the most special students in the world #</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Out of slugs.</p>
<p>Next time, I'll put you square, you pickle-sucking MacGillycuddy.</p>
<p>Why did you save me, Dean? I know how important paintball is to you, Abed.</p>
<p>I wanted you to win.</p>
<p>It's not important anymore.</p>
<p>I get it now.</p>
<p>It just feels forced.</p>
<p>You just enjoy your prize.</p>

<p>Lame! Okay.</p>
<p>That was great, but you really didn't need to go into it.</p>
<p>You know what occurs to me? What all those great Greendale memories have in common? I was barely in them? They were all about Dean Pelton.</p>
<p>That's what I've been trying to make you guys understand for the last two months.</p>
<p>I keep telling you, we weren't expelled by the real Dean.</p>
<p>It couldn't have been him.</p>
<p>He loved us.</p>
<p>Maybe we've been so concerned with moving past Greendale, we've been living in denial.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>I mean, let's face it.</p>
<p>We weren't driven crazy by Greendale.</p>
<p>And Abed's not the crazy one for obsessing about it.</p>
<p>Abed, we're sorry.</p>
<p>We haven't been supporting you, and we haven't been honest with ourselves.</p>
<p>Dr. Heidi, something weird is going on with that school.</p>
<p>Abed doesn't need to be here.</p>
<p>We need to be there.</p>
<p>But there is no there.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>That's why we have to go back.</p>
<p>No, you can't go back to Greendale.</p>
<p>Why? Because it isn't healthy? 'Cause it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I parked by a meter.</p>
<p>Any of y'all park by a meter? Wait, what? What you mean, Greendale doesn't exist? Well, there is a place called Greendale, and you all spent three years there, but it was not a community college.</p>
<p>These memories that you people have been sharing are a shared psychosis.</p>
<p>You were patients there together, you were released together, and I am alarmed to see that you are now relapsing together.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This is not real.</p>
<p>You're lying.</p>
<p>Search your mind for the real memories.</p>
<p>Try to look past the trauma you've been blocking out.</p>
<p>What trauma?—You all came to this community college after your lives had fractured.</p>
<p>Pill addiction, failed legal career, broken marriage, lost scholarship,—old.</p>
<p>Enough! I don't want to hear mine.</p>
<p>And, if we were going to fabricate a delusion, why would we fabricate a community college? Ah, yes, this fantastical community college where everything that happens is unbelievably ridiculous and it all revolves around you as a group.</p>
<p>The same reason anyone plunges into psychosis, miss Perry.</p>
<p>It was a mentally-compatible alternative to your grim reality.</p>
<p>Can you believe the secret trampoline we found? I know.</p>
<p>It's so great.</p>
<p>For Greendale! Charge! Come on, Leonard.</p>
<p>Yow!—Ooh!  baby boomer Santa   thank you for everything   you're welcome, you're welcome   for everything in the world —Terry, stop it.</p>
<p>* You're welcome, hey *—Let's do a clip show.</p>
<p>Bottle episode.</p>
<p>Don't forget the clip show.</p>
<p>Harrison Ford.</p>
<p>Remember when we went camping? Yes.</p>
<p>Remember when we painted the nursery? Yes.</p>
<p>Remember when we remembered going camping while we were in the nursery? I'm a millionaire, I'm an inventor, I'm a legend, and I had sex with Eartha Kitt.</p>
<p>It's sad.</p>
<p>Should we increase their lithium? Not yet.</p>
<p>I want to see what happens if we confiscate one of their pens.</p>
<p>It's not possible.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>You say you started as a Spanish study group.</p>
<p>Do any of you speak Spanish? Mi hambre es bombero tirantes.</p>
<p>And you've attended Greendale for three years, but don't community colleges end after two? Everyone's always saying that.</p>
<p>The average community college student attends school five to seven years.</p>
<p>Many offer four-year degrees.</p>
<p>In your mind, they do.</p>
<p>In your mind.</p>
<p>And you shared this delusion with each other, like that time all those people got into swing dance music back in the '90s.</p>
<p>And then you were released, probably because your insurance ran out.</p>
<p>But the official story is that you're now fit to live within society again.</p>
<p>You just have to accept the truth.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Give me a break.</p>
<p>That made no sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's me.</p>
<p>No, I think they bought it.</p>
<p>I had to do a little riffing at the end, but I was pretty convincing.</p>
<p>Well, if it looks like I'm sneaking out the window, it's just a symptom of your deepening psychosis.</p>
<p>Don't hurt me.</p>
<p>Greendale doesn't exist? How long did you think we'd buy that? I'm literally carrying a Greendale backpack.</p>
<p>I have, like, 1,000 pictures of the campus on my phone.</p>
<p>I have children I see every day.</p>
<p>I have definitely not been locked up.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Why would you lie to make us think we were crazy? Because, Ms. Edison, Greendale is purgatory, and I am the devil.</p>
<p>What?—I knew it.</p>
<p>Stop letting him make you realize stuff.</p>
<p>These aren't even good lies.</p>
<p>All right, fine, I had to come up with something.</p>
<p>You were getting too close.</p>
<p>Close to what? To the truth.</p>
<p>The Indian kid was right.</p>
<p>He's Arabic.</p>
<p>Also Polish.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm a fake psychiatrist, not a fake ethnologist.</p>
<p>The point is your Dean was kidnapped by Ben Chang and replaced with a double.</p>
<p>I was hired to keep you off the scent.</p>
<p>Chang kidnapped the Dean? Even for him, that's insane.</p>
<p>Is it? Think about it.</p>
<p>Whoo! I said hot damn! Chang What are you doing? I'm predicting future crimes.</p>
<p>Now I'm sick.</p>
<p>See, you said that would happen.</p>
<p>You are a pre-cog! Again.</p>
<p>You're weak.</p>
<p>Uh, guys, while we were remembering Chang is crazy, the fake doctor sneaked away.</p>
<p>Oh, crap!—What? There goes our only chance of clearing our names.</p>
<p>You guys, forget about us.</p>
<p>The Dean has been kidnapped.</p>

<p>I'm not crazy.</p>
<p>Well, Abed, I don't deal in crazy.</p>
<p>I deal in health.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So how long has Abed needed a crazy amount of help? All of this behavior started after you were expelled? There may have been a ramp-up.</p>
<p>It's okay, buddy.</p>
<p>Just a few more minutes, and we're good until spring, okay? But it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>We get the hour back later in the year.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I "Rent Tower Heist" last night, and I won't spoil the ending, but let me tell you, it was quite the hilarious Thrill Ride.</p>
<p>That Brett Ratner, he's a master at comedic action-adventure.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>A master at storytelling.</p>
<p>He's just a master at making movies in general.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it.</p>
<p>He's the new Spielberg.</p>
<p>Oh! I have to go.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You're a bad person.</p>
<p>You're a bad person.</p>
<p>Time enough at last to eat a sandwich.</p>
<p>Though even he knew that this sandwich was nearer his last sandwich than his first.</p>
<p>Abed, I'm trying to eat.</p>
<p>He said, oldly, his brittle bones straining to support the weight of his wrinkly skin.</p>
<p>Stop narrating me.</p>
<p>He shouted to no one, just a man alone in time with nothing but the cold squishiness of tuna salad to comfort him.</p>
<p>I take it back.</p>
<p>I don't want to be in your novel.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne had nearly lost his grip on reality.</p>
<p>Lately, he'd begun to think he was in a novel.</p>
<p>And action.</p>
<p>Abed, what the hell are you doing? Cut.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>One more for safety.</p>
<p>Abed, it's 4:30 in the morning, and you're in my bedroom.</p>
<p>Use that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And action.</p>
<p>But that's almost completely nearly all of it.</p>
<p>If Abed is as sick as you all say, then I have no Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Nobody in this room gets to define sick.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I'm a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Any kind of doctor can really.</p>
<p>Really?—Yes.</p>
<p>Well, if Abed's sick, then we're all sick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can't determine a person's sanity from a few amusing stories.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I mean, if anything, Abed's more sane than any of us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I mean, he's certainly the craziest one of us, but, you know, we're all kind of crazy-town banana pants.</p>
<p>Talk to me about crazy-town banana pants.</p>
<p>Look, we're just saying it's been a crazy year for everybody.</p>
<p>Who among us hasn't had the odd banana in his or her pants, right? I have.</p>
<p>How long does peyote last? Just asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed and Annie in the morning  What are you doing? Nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing my ass.</p>
<p>What are all these cameras doing here? Here, take my coat.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That's so sweet.</p>
<p>Just don't eat anything or drink anything, and no sweating or bending at the elbows, and no chairs with backrests, and if you take it off, wooden hangers only.</p>
<p>You're probably warm now, right? Good news, guys.</p>
<p>I spent all my money.</p>
<p>Troy, you can't bring that in here.</p>
<p>Yes, I can.</p>
<p>It's all-terrain, dummy.</p>
<p>I made a plate of cookies for the study group, but my boys ate them, so since they took something of yours, you all get something of theirs.</p>
<p>Elijah loves this, Britta.</p>
<p>There you go, Jeff.</p>
<p>There you go, Troy.</p>
<p>There you go, Pierce.</p>
<p>Karate championship, second place! Now I'll be unstoppable.</p>
<p>Oyay! So you see what you call insanity we call solidarity.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>We just finished telling him about it, and you grab it and squeeze it?—I said I was sorry.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And so as a group, do you always indulge Abed in these little misadventures? Take that back.</p>
<p>Our adventures are very manly.</p>
<p>I have to say there's more important to mental health than a support system.</p>
<p>And assuming that this group is, for Abed, said support system, I think I've heard everything I need to hear in order to make a decision.</p>
<p>I think that Abed should be committed.</p>
<p>You mean committed to his character work, right? Because he already is.</p>
<p>Abed, show him your Don Draper.</p>
<p>Cigarettes.</p>
<p>No, I mean an institution.</p>
<p>You mean like marriage? I mean a mental institution.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>So do I.</p>
<p>Will someone please help me lighten the mood? Please, Mr. Dr. Psychiatrist, sir, please don't send my best friend to crazy people jail.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>He doesn't have the right.</p>
<p>Abed's not dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's just unique, like a snowflake who gets bent out of shape when you mix up Star Wars and space treks.</p>
<p>Or a serial killer's signature.</p>
<p>I'm a psych major.</p>
<p>His continued obsession with Greendale Community College suggests the potential for escalation.</p>
<p>And, frankly, these stories you've been telling me are very troubling.</p>
<p>You're troubled? I don't remember any of those things happening.</p>
<p>Since when do these three live together? Look, Abed's obsession with Greendale doesn't make him crazy.</p>
<p>If you had gone to school there, you'd be obsessed with it too.</p>
<p>It was a messed-up place.</p>
<p>We had lockers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're survivors.</p>
<p>My name is Pwofussa Wobinswin.</p>
<p>Who's weady to wearn? Dean, this is not the way to agree on parking for the job fair! It's inhumane.</p>
<p>You have a better idea, Britta? Yes.</p>
<p>Thousands of them.</p>
<p>Vicki to Queen 3.</p>
<p>Neigh.</p>
<p>That's all for today.</p>
<p>Read chapter four.</p>
<p>Okay, we're just gonna ignore that.</p>
<p>Bananas?—Yes.</p>
<p>Toast?—Yes.</p>
<p>Bubble gum?—Yes.</p>
<p>Pancakes?—Yes.</p>
<p>Fries?—Get out.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>There's one every year.</p>
<p>I will not tolerate clowning.</p>
<p>Car keys?—Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, last bathroom break.</p>
<p>We've got to cram for Excuse me, sir, can we get to our Slow your bones, Rufus.</p>
<p>We got a long road tomorrow.</p>
<p>Welcome to ladders.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Just wanted to see if we got the same thing.</p>
<p>It sounds as though this Greendale had quite an effect on all of you.</p>
<p>You should all definitely stop dwelling on it if you want to be healthy.</p>
<p>Well, come on, it wasn't all bad.</p>
<p>I was there longer than anybody, and I'm fine.</p>
<p>How are you? Why do you ask? Uh-oh.</p>
<p>What Pierce was saying before he started sundowning is true.</p>
<p>We can't just pass the crazy buck to Greendale.</p>
<p>It could be a good place too.</p>
<p>That really doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a lot of memories of Greendale being in our corner.</p>
<p>Dean-a-ling.</p>
<p>I just wanted to drop by and tell you we ought to be hot-stepping it out to the parking lot in a brisk, but orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Is there a fire drill? No, sir, there's an actual fire.</p>
<p>I wanted you guys to be the first to know before I tell everyone else.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's not right to play favorites, but it is no more right to sit on your feelings, and I don't know what I'd do without you guys.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Okay, fire, fire! There's a fire! Darcy, you've got a cold.</p>
<p>I feel fine.</p>
<p>You're sick.</p>
<p>Go home! Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get out of here! I can't believe we got here too late for pizza.</p>
<p>Worst pizza day ever.</p>
<p>Oh, darn it.</p>
<p>What am I gonna do with all this garbage? Psst, it's me, the Dean.</p>
<p>I pulled the last six pieces of pizza for you.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Back to garbage detail.</p>
<p>We have a few students with birthdays today, but, hey, why single them out? What about the students who aren't celebrating anything at all? Are they any less special?</p>
<p># Troy and Jeffrey #</p>
<p># And Annie and Britta # </p>
<p># And Shirley and Pierce # </p>
<p># And Abed and Jeffrey #</p>
<p># Just a few of the most special students in the world #</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Out of slugs.</p>
<p>Next time, I'll put you square, you pickle-sucking MacGillycuddy.</p>
<p>Why did you save me, Dean? I know how important paintball is to you, Abed.</p>
<p>I wanted you to win.</p>
<p>It's not important anymore.</p>
<p>I get it now.</p>
<p>It just feels forced.</p>
<p>You just enjoy your prize.</p>

<p>Lame! Okay.</p>
<p>That was great, but you really didn't need to go into it.</p>
<p>You know what occurs to me? What all those great Greendale memories have in common? I was barely in them? They were all about Dean Pelton.</p>
<p>That's what I've been trying to make you guys understand for the last two months.</p>
<p>I keep telling you, we weren't expelled by the real Dean.</p>
<p>It couldn't have been him.</p>
<p>He loved us.</p>
<p>Maybe we've been so concerned with moving past Greendale, we've been living in denial.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>I mean, let's face it.</p>
<p>We weren't driven crazy by Greendale.</p>
<p>And Abed's not the crazy one for obsessing about it.</p>
<p>Abed, we're sorry.</p>
<p>We haven't been supporting you, and we haven't been honest with ourselves.</p>
<p>Dr. Heidi, something weird is going on with that school.</p>
<p>Abed doesn't need to be here.</p>
<p>We need to be there.</p>
<p>But there is no there.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>That's why we have to go back.</p>
<p>No, you can't go back to Greendale.</p>
<p>Why? Because it isn't healthy? 'Cause it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I parked by a meter.</p>
<p>Any of y'all park by a meter? Wait, what? What you mean, Greendale doesn't exist? Well, there is a place called Greendale, and you all spent three years there, but it was not a community college.</p>
<p>These memories that you people have been sharing are a shared psychosis.</p>
<p>You were patients there together, you were released together, and I am alarmed to see that you are now relapsing together.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This is not real.</p>
<p>You're lying.</p>
<p>Search your mind for the real memories.</p>
<p>Try to look past the trauma you've been blocking out.</p>
<p>What trauma?—You all came to this community college after your lives had fractured.</p>
<p>Pill addiction, failed legal career, broken marriage, lost scholarship,—old.</p>
<p>Enough! I don't want to hear mine.</p>
<p>And, if we were going to fabricate a delusion, why would we fabricate a community college? Ah, yes, this fantastical community college where everything that happens is unbelievably ridiculous and it all revolves around you as a group.</p>
<p>The same reason anyone plunges into psychosis, miss Perry.</p>
<p>It was a mentally-compatible alternative to your grim reality.</p>
<p>Can you believe the secret trampoline we found? I know.</p>
<p>It's so great.</p>
<p>For Greendale! Charge! Come on, Leonard.</p>
<p>Yow!—Ooh!  baby boomer Santa   thank you for everything   you're welcome, you're welcome   for everything in the world —Terry, stop it.</p>
<p>* You're welcome, hey *—Let's do a clip show.</p>
<p>Bottle episode.</p>
<p>Don't forget the clip show.</p>
<p>Harrison Ford.</p>
<p>Remember when we went camping? Yes.</p>
<p>Remember when we painted the nursery? Yes.</p>
<p>Remember when we remembered going camping while we were in the nursery? I'm a millionaire, I'm an inventor, I'm a legend, and I had sex with Eartha Kitt.</p>
<p>It's sad.</p>
<p>Should we increase their lithium? Not yet.</p>
<p>I want to see what happens if we confiscate one of their pens.</p>
<p>It's not possible.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>You say you started as a Spanish study group.</p>
<p>Do any of you speak Spanish? Mi hambre es bombero tirantes.</p>
<p>And you've attended Greendale for three years, but don't community colleges end after two? Everyone's always saying that.</p>
<p>The average community college student attends school five to seven years.</p>
<p>Many offer four-year degrees.</p>
<p>In your mind, they do.</p>
<p>In your mind.</p>
<p>And you shared this delusion with each other, like that time all those people got into swing dance music back in the '90s.</p>
<p>And then you were released, probably because your insurance ran out.</p>
<p>But the official story is that you're now fit to live within society again.</p>
<p>You just have to accept the truth.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Give me a break.</p>
<p>That made no sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's me.</p>
<p>No, I think they bought it.</p>
<p>I had to do a little riffing at the end, but I was pretty convincing.</p>
<p>Well, if it looks like I'm sneaking out the window, it's just a symptom of your deepening psychosis.</p>
<p>Don't hurt me.</p>
<p>Greendale doesn't exist? How long did you think we'd buy that? I'm literally carrying a Greendale backpack.</p>
<p>I have, like, 1,000 pictures of the campus on my phone.</p>
<p>I have children I see every day.</p>
<p>I have definitely not been locked up.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Why would you lie to make us think we were crazy? Because, Ms. Edison, Greendale is purgatory, and I am the devil.</p>
<p>What?—I knew it.</p>
<p>Stop letting him make you realize stuff.</p>
<p>These aren't even good lies.</p>
<p>All right, fine, I had to come up with something.</p>
<p>You were getting too close.</p>
<p>Close to what? To the truth.</p>
<p>The Indian kid was right.</p>
<p>He's Arabic.</p>
<p>Also Polish.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm a fake psychiatrist, not a fake ethnologist.</p>
<p>The point is your Dean was kidnapped by Ben Chang and replaced with a double.</p>
<p>I was hired to keep you off the scent.</p>
<p>Chang kidnapped the Dean? Even for him, that's insane.</p>
<p>Is it? Think about it.</p>
<p>Whoo! I said hot damn! Chang What are you doing? I'm predicting future crimes.</p>
<p>Now I'm sick.</p>
<p>See, you said that would happen.</p>
<p>You are a pre-cog! Again.</p>
<p>You're weak.</p>
<p>Uh, guys, while we were remembering Chang is crazy, the fake doctor sneaked away.</p>
<p>Oh, crap!—What? There goes our only chance of clearing our names.</p>
<p>You guys, forget about us.</p>
<p>The Dean has been kidnapped.</p>
<p>He's out there somewhere, alone and cold and most likely trying to cobble together a sexy Patty Hearst costume.</p>
<p>Britta's right.</p>
<p>Wait, what? We need to rescue the Dean.</p>
<p>We need to get back to that school.</p>
<p>And we definitely never need to do another paintball.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, therapy does work.</p>
<p>We're cured.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Sounds like the study group has gotten wise to Operation Doppel-Deaner.</p>
<p>It's time for phase two.</p>
<p>What's phase two? Hey, I'm making up the same plan you are.</p>
<p>Pitches, pitches, pitches.</p>
<p>Ah, thank you, Megan.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed in the morning  Nights.</p>
<p>Welcome back, all you night owls.</p>
<p>Troy, why don't we open up the phone lines? Talk to us, lonely hearts.</p>
<p>We got Jeff W. calling.</p>
<p>Hello? Hey, Jeff, what's your question?—Who is this?—Great question.</p>
<p>We're us.</p>
<p>You guys, it's 3:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>I'm trying to sleep.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that, Jeff.</p>
<p>Why don't you stay on the line and we'll get your information.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll get you the help you need.</p>
<p>Our next caller's Annie E.</p>
<p>What's on your mind tonight, Annie? Hey, guys, long time, first time, love the show.</p>
<p>Aw, appreciate ya.</p>
<p>How can we help? You can shut up and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Well, Jacks and Jills, that's about all the time we have tonight.</p>
<p>Yeah, until next time, may your dreams be sweet and your nightmares be "spooky monster" scary and not "grandma died" scary.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed in the morning  Nights.</p>
