<p>So then the guy says to the housekeeper: "Make sure she's dead." </p>
<p>Stop me if you've heard this before.</p>
<p>Would've been nice.</p>
<p>The housekeeper says to the guy, "We don't have a pool." </p>
<p>And the guy says -</p>
<p>Good morning, Greendale.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, our debate team will bring home the championship tomorrow versus City College.</p>
<p>Go, Human Beings.</p>
<p>Great, now I gotta start the whole joke over again.</p>
<p>Okay, so this -</p>
<p>No! I've got one for you.</p>
<p>A doddering old fool walks into a bar, tells a stupid joke, and I crush his windpipe with my three-ringed binder.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>Britta's trying to give up cigarettes.</p>
<p>Don't tell them my business.</p>
<p>I'll slap that look off your pointy face.</p>
<p>Britta, I'm saying this because I care about you and you're my friend.</p>
<p>You need to start smoking again.</p>
<p>I really think you should.</p>
<p>You lose weight and your skin looks great when you smoke.</p>
<p>Guys, I appreciate your support, but I've got to quit.</p>
<p>Have you thought about hypnotherapy? I know a hypnotherapist.</p>
<p>Ten-to-one says it's him.</p>
<p>His name is Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>And I'm very effective.</p>
<p>Can you help me block out people's voices I find extremely annoying? Jeff, she's right there.</p>
<p>Pierce, I would be grateful for your help.</p>
<p>You would? Super.</p>
<p>I'll set it up.</p>
<p>What? I feel bad for him.</p>
<p>Plus, I just yelled at him.</p>
<p>You yelled at me too.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Did I hurt your feelings, pointy face? Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Have you seen the film department's website? What do you think? All of Abed's films are about us.</p>
<p>What? Check it out.</p>
<p>What else is new? Jeff.</p>
<p>Hola.</p>
<p>Jeff, stop being so relaxed.</p>
<p>We need to talk to you about You're living out of your car.</p>
<p>Why on earth are you living out of your car? Those people look just like us.</p>
<p>That's eerie.</p>
<p>Fine, it's true.</p>
<p>I'm living out of my car.</p>
<p>And I don't want anyone's help.</p>
<p>We had almost that exact conversation last week.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Abed posted this video two weeks ago.</p>
<p>That boy is a soothsayer.</p>
<p>This is wrinkling my brain.</p>
<p>This is wrinkling my brain.</p>
<p>That's wrinkling my brain.</p>
<p>Get a load of these wrinkles.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Who's that old guy? Hi.</p>
<p>I'm Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Did you to hear my announcement? I hang on every word.</p>
<p>I assume that's sarcasm.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You didn't hear? I'm barely listening now.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>My debate partner dropped out.</p>
<p>We need you for the championship.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, as debate coach, I'm offering you an opportunity to spend a night drinking from the cup of life rather than romancing your nether regions in front of the E! Channel.</p>
<p>Come on, Jeff, who better than a former lawyer to really stick it to those City College snobs and their star debater, Simmons? Mmm.</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>Okay, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Okay, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Listen, jerk wad.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, that got heated.</p>
<p>Greendale needs a win.</p>
<p>The best compliment our sports program gets is that our basketball team is really gay.</p>
<p>So, what's it gonna take? A plum parking space? Free meals? A night of companionship, if you know what I mean? I'll do it for the parking space.</p>
<p>And if you promise not to tell me what you mean.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pierce, thank you.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you helping me out.</p>
<p>And I appreciate the opportunity.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I think people don't take me seriously.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do? Wave a pocket watch in front of my face and tell me I'm getting very sleepy.</p>
<p>Just checking the time.</p>
<p>Now close your eyes and keep them closed at all times.</p>
<p>And listen to the soothing sound of my voice.</p>
<p>The only word that will bring you out is "gorilla." </p>
<p>Okay, now, focus on the rhythm of your own breathing.</p>
<p>And when you feel the desire to light up a cigarette you will associate these urges with things in your life that disgust you.</p>
<p>Bad tasting food, sex with men, wearing attractive clothing.</p>
<p>Oh, God, I think I really hurt myself.</p>
<p>Somebody help me.</p>
<p>Oh! Britta, wake up.</p>
<p>Why did I put you under so well? Damn my talents.</p>
<p>Aah! The topic for the debate is, "Are people inherently good or evil?" When do you want to get together to strategize? Annie, I was a lawyer.</p>
<p>I was a debater for money.</p>
<p>I think I can handle this.</p>
<p>So how was hypnotherapy? He fell down while I laid there to make him feel like a good hypnotherapist.</p>
<p>You realize this will never end.</p>
<p>It's already done.</p>
<p>He just wants one more session.</p>
<p># Wah-waah! #</p>
<p>Where's Abed? I need to talk to him about his films.</p>
<p>That boy is flat-out prescient.</p>
<p>He can read our minds.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You watched my movies.</p>
<p>He's a witch.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>I'm not a witch.</p>
<p>I'm a student of human character.</p>
<p>I know you guys all so well I can predict your behavior.</p>
<p>Like, Shirley, I know you're a sweet, Christian, generous person.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>I know you have rage issues.</p>
<p>Careful, boy.</p>
<p>Oh! Careful, boy.</p>
<p>Here, check this out.</p>
<p>May I? Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jeff acts like nothing affects him, but things bother him more than he lets on.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm top of the class.</p>
<p>He's also very vain.</p>
<p>Pfft! Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Why am I crying? Will I listen to "Come Sail Away" by <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Styx</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1381746'>Styx</a></span><span class='years'>&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159097'>tt0159097</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419984'>tt0419984</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480687'>tt0480687</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112508'>tt0112508</a></span></span></span></span> again? Don't worry, Troy, it's just a movie.</p>
<p>I can't predict the future.</p>
<p>I hurt my leg.</p>
<p>Ah! What up, happy people? You tell me my future right now, evil wizard.</p>
<p>By the way, I think your shirt's trying to get out of your pants.</p>
<p>As Golding's Lord of the Flies demonstrates, man, when left to his own devices, will descend into chaos and evil.</p>
<p>And now, from City College, Jeremy Simmons.</p>
<p>Jeremy.</p>
<p>Jeremy.</p>
<p>Jeremy.</p>
<p>Jeremy.</p>
<p>There were 23,000 kidney donations in America last year.</p>
<p>Man is good.</p>
<p>The average life expectancy for a man in a community is 23 years longer than a man alone.</p>
<p>Man is good.</p>
<p>And just 10 minutes ago, a bald, bespectacled man held the door for a man in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Man is good.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>I hate this guy.</p>
<p>By the end of this debate I will prove with facts and data that man is inherently good.</p>
<p>Little trick for achieving the proper competitive mind set.</p>
<p>I always envision my opponent having aggressive sex with my mother.</p>
<p>This feels so formal.</p>
<p>Let's just talk.</p>
<p>People are evil.</p>
<p>They can't help it.</p>
<p>I didn't catch your name.</p>
<p>It's Jean.</p>
<p>Take Jean here.</p>
<p>She spent a lot of time this morning making herself look so lovely.</p>
<p>Tell me, how many people bothered to tell you how great you look today? None.</p>
<p>Man is evil.</p>
<p>But you just said how great I looked.</p>
<p>For my own selfish purposes.</p>
<p>The fact is, as hot as you look and it is quite hot, I wouldn't have said anything.</p>
<p>When I talk about people being evil, I could cite quotes, or dig up statistics, but those are just words and numbers.</p>
<p>I think we could have a little more fun if I express myself in song.</p>
<p># Evil woman #</p>
<p># Evil woman #</p>
<p>That's my time, everybody.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At the end of round one.</p>
<p>City College, 50.</p>
<p>Greendale, eight.</p>
<p>I got eight? I only got eight? She got eight.</p>
<p>You got zero.</p>

<p>All sizzle, no steak.</p>
<p>I don't care, dude.</p>
<p>I'm doing this for a parking space.</p>
<p>Let's go, boys.</p>
<p>Come on, let's go.</p>
<p>I wanna see some hustlers out there.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>By Zeus.</p>
<p>What sort of jackassery is this? We're in the middle of a debate.</p>
<p>We reserved the gym for practice so Yup, they reserved it.</p>
<p>Okay, they got us by the short ones.</p>
<p>The debate is suspended until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hopefully, by then we can get our act together.</p>
<p>Oh, great try, Bruce.</p>
<p>Great try.</p>
<p>When are we getting together to prepare for tomorrow? Never.</p>
<p>Because it's stupid and I don't care.</p>
<p>Bite me.</p>
<p>Maybe Simmons is right.</p>
<p>You really are all sizzle and no steak.</p>
<p>You probably couldn't beat him.</p>
<p>What do you mean, I can't beat him? You and I are going to study harder and beat City College tomorrow.</p>
<p>Really? No.</p>

Abed is right, you act like things don't bother you, but they do.</p>
<p>Look, six months ago I was a lawyer.</p>
<p>I wore suits.</p>
<p>I used to say stuff like "objection" and "sidebar." </p>
<p>Now I'm losing a community college debate to Jeremy "Soul Patch" Simmons.</p>
<p>Hey, Winger.</p>
<p>You like to sing? I like to sing too.</p>
<p># Zero for Winger #</p>
<p>Kick that.</p>
<p># Was a big shot lawyer #</p>
<p># Now he's a loser #</p>
<p>Lay off, Simmons.</p>
<p>Jeff didn't understand the rules.</p>
<p>Yeah? What's your excuse, eight points? Dude, leave her out of this.</p>
<p># Little Annie Adderall #</p>
<p># Was an outcast in high school #</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Dude, we are gonna debate the living crap out of you.</p>
<p>We've got some preparing to do.</p>
<p>I liked you better smoking.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You're right, my feet are long and stupid.</p>
<p>You can't unring that bell.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>That's my newspaper.</p>
<p>What do you need a paper for? You knew what was gonna happen, you Magic Eight Ball.</p>
<p>Pierce hurt his leg.</p>
<p>Britta made Troy cry.</p>
<p>What's my destiny? Am I gonna die in a car? Is it going to happen soon? Shirley, I'm just an entertainer.</p>
<p>But if it will make you feel better, here, let me show you what I'm working on.</p>
<p>Were --</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Were Is that me being chased down by a werewolf? Yeah, that's how you'd behave in that situation.</p>
<p>No? The situation being me being chased down by a werewolf.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>And that's Jeff locking lips with Annie? Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're a fool.</p>
<p>Stanford students were divided into prisoners and guards.</p>
<p>The guards immediately started to abuse Ugh! What's wrong? I have this pain above my eyebrow.</p>
<p>It's a stress headache.</p>
<p>I got my first one when I was 4.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>Well, get to used to it.</p>
<p>You're knee-deep in it, brother.</p>
<p>This is debate.</p>
<p>If you want to win, you need to prepare.</p>
<p>Well, agreed.</p>
<p>But if you want to win, you need to loosen up.</p>
<p>Go off-book, robot debater.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Simmons is so good at using his inherent magnetism to sell his points and here I am, like a spinster librarian with my hair pulled back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think? Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>Abed thinks you two are going to kiss.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha! Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Us kissing.</p>
<p>That is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>We should get back to work.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The People are inherently evil.</p>
<p>Oh, we can use this Hobbes quote.</p>
<p>"Man is a collection of base, animal urges." </p>
<p>To act on them and experience sinful pleasure "would be morally no different than taking a breath." </p>
<p>That's poignant, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, maybe we should study alone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Separately.</p>
<p>That way we can be more reproductive Productive.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Oh, you forgot your phone.</p>
<p>Oh, I can get another one.</p>
<p>The next time you even see a cigarette, you will think of things that disgust you.</p>
<p>And while you're under so deep, you'll find yourself attracted to slightly older men.</p>
<p>Perhaps some barrel-chested stud with just enough, heh, tummy to love.</p>
<p>You'll want to buy him dinner.</p>
<p>Then go back to his hot tub.</p>
<p>You'll invite one of your friends to join us for a three-way.</p>
<p>Maybe someone with low self-esteem and slightly larger breasts.</p>
<p>Go to hell, you disgusting pig.</p>
<p>A-ha! Pierce, I was awake the whole time.</p>
<p>I was faking it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I saw you.</p>
<p>What do you think I am? Some joke? No.</p>
<p>No, I was trying to make you feel better about yourself.</p>
<p>How dare you pity me.</p>
<p>I may be a little older, my ideas may seem weird, my fashion sense may cause envy, but I have a lot to offer and I will not to be pitied.</p>
<p>Do not help me up.</p>
<p>And as German poet Franz Wickmeyer once wrote: "Snow falls from the heavens pure. We cannot blame the snow for being soiled by the Earth." Man is good.</p>
<p>What? That dude gets it.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger will now offer a two-minute rebuttal.</p>
<p>Hey, sizzle.</p>
<p>What are you going to sing tonight? I'm in the mood for <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Sade</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0755442'>Sade</a></span><span class='years'>1959&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>composer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029'>tt0446029</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503'>tt0111503</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596350'>tt1596350</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098273'>tt0098273</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>In the Stanford Prison Experiment, when given absolute power, abused and tortured their fellow students.</p>
<p>My competitor likened people to pure, falling snow.</p>
<p>I would respond, "There is none righteous, no, not one." </p>
<p>Now, I realize Mr. Simmons' quote was from the great Franz Wickmeyer.</p>
<p>Mine was just from a simple desert handyman named Jesus.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>

<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>We make an amazing team.</p>
<p>I know, we're so in sync, we're like a perfect duet or great se Hey, Professor Whitman.</p>
<p>Your preparation was impeccable.</p>
<p>You remind me of a young me with slightly worse hair.</p>
<p>I just checked with the judges.</p>
<p>They'll need a miracle to win in rebuttal.</p>
<p>Simmons is finished.</p>
<p>This is too much for me.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>He's going off-book.</p>
<p>Why is he ripping the cards, doesn't he need the cards? It's a gambit.</p>
<p>He hates me, yet he caught me.</p>
<p>Man is good.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>He was horny, so he dropped him.</p>
<p>Man is evil.</p>

<p>Huzzah! Eat that, Simmons.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>That off-book enough for you? Simmons got robbed.</p>
<p>They kissed.</p>
<p>You do have powers.</p>
<p>I'm going to die by werewolf.</p>
<p>Shirley, I don't have powers.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>In my next film, we discover Pierce is an actual genius.</p>
<p>That's not gonna happen.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>Pierce, I can't smoke a cigarette without thinking of a three-way in your hot tub.</p>
<p>You did it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I did? You're a genius.</p>
<p>Who's the third? You did great in there.</p>
<p>Let's take this bacchanalia outside.</p>
