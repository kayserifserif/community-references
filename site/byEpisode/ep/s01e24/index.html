<p>It's hard to believe , but finals are here.</p>
<p>And I know that during this stressful time, my voice blaring over a PA can't help.</p>
<p>Which is why, for the next three days, you'll hear nothing but soothing sounds of nature.</p>
<p>And to kick it off, here's a babbling brook.</p>
<p>Will anyone back me up if I say this is ridiculous, or is it gonna be another Avatar situation? I love Avatar.</p>
<p>What's an avatar? Okay.</p>
<p>Nature sounds or not, we're not gonna have trouble passing our Spanish final.</p>
<p>I've transcribed this semester's notes from my digital recorder.</p>
<p>You record every class? Pfft.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>You mean nerd alert.</p>
<p>Alert nerd.</p>
<p>Here's a spoiler.</p>
<p>We're all gonna spend the next three days boning up.</p>
<p>Then pass the exam and move on to Spanish 103.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good ending, Annie.</p>
<p>Except for where I take Spanish 103.</p>
<p>What do you mean? Spanish 102 fills my language requirement.</p>
<p>I guess I just figured we're a Spanish study group, so we'd keep taking Spanish together.</p>
<p>That's what I thought too, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>I'm on a tight, four-year schedule to replace my bachelor's.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna take an extra class.</p>
<p>Spanish has value beyond credit.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I know the family downstairs hates me.</p>
<p>I don't need to understand why.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>You want me to say it? I'll say it.</p>
<p>I like this group.</p>
<p>I want it to stay together.</p>
<p>Oh, I think so too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like this group.</p>
<p>Yeah, you be the cool guy, Jeff.</p>
<p>And next fall when that gets lonely, I'll be in the front row of Spanish 103.</p>
<p>Monday through Friday, Six And now, crickets.</p>
<p>Okay, if we're not interested in Spanish 103 next year, what about Anthropology? Ooh.</p>
<p>Anthropology, the study of man.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to forget what I learned about that subject.</p>
<p>Hee, hee.</p>
<p>Go, girl.</p>
<p>You just go-girled yourself.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>See, it's fun.</p>
<p>And they have a class at noon.</p>
<p>Noon, everybody.</p>
<p>Anthropology? Anthropology? Anthropology? Annie, I'm not big on planning ahead, but I have one unmovable appointment May 23rd, 2013.</p>
<p>To buy a flying car? I have a table for one at Morty's Steakhouse where I will celebrate becoming a lawyer again which can only happen if I take a full load.</p>
<p>Don't.</p>
<p>A full load of classes every year, I can maybe make it until then.</p>
<p>But not by building my schedule around BFFs.</p>
<p>We'll build ours around yours.</p>
<p>Annie, you realize we'll be friends whether or not we have a class together, right? Of course you think that.</p>
<p>Obvious from your name your parents smoked pot.</p>
<p>All right, well, I haven't said a single word in this entire conversation and I find that outrageous.</p>
<p>Hola, el losers.</p>
<p>Winger, may I have a word with you in private? Sure.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Okay, come back in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And if anyone asks, I sent you to learn things.</p>
<p>And, Pierce, close the door, please.</p>
<p>Other side of the door.</p>
<p>So you're here because your college degree was fake, right? I prefer the term better than real, but yes.</p>
<p>Two questions.</p>
<p>Where did you get it? Could you have prevented being caught, and how? One question.</p>
<p>Where did you learn to count questions? Are you telling me you need a fake degree? You know, in high school, I was in a band.</p>
<p>We could've been huge, but the world wasn't ready for an Asian man on keytar.</p>
<p>Did you say "keytar" or did you just pronounce guitar like a hillbilly? Keytar.</p>
<p>It's a keyboard you can play like a guitar.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Get with the times, man.</p>
<p>Anyway, next thing you know, I'm 32, and I'm bagging groceries for, like, 5 bucks an hour plus tips.</p>
<p>Shocked? Confused.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to tip my bag boy? So I did what anyone would do.</p>
<p>I faked my way into a job as a Spanish teacher at a community college, relying on phrases from Sesame Street.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Save the judgment, Winger, all right? If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.</p>
<p>That was the chair.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>It's unsolvable.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I forgot my Hey.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing? Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, come back here.</p>
<p>Come back here.</p>
<p>Jerry.</p>
<p>Hey, Jerry, check this out.</p>
<p>And that is what Milton was really saying.</p>
<p>Okay, exams are on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Class dismissed.</p>
<p>If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.</p>
<p>If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.</p>
<p>That was the chair.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Hi, everybody.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, kids.</p>
<p>Well, it's actually bad news for the older people as well.</p>
<p>Señor Chang is no longer with us.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>He's not faking his death again, is he? Because I can't handle that.</p>
<p>First, he's alive.</p>
<p>Then we're happy.</p>
<p>And then he's alive again and I received an anonymous tip that Chang had misrepresented certain aspects of his qualifications.</p>
<p>For instance, having them.</p>
<p>Word of advice, if an Asian man says he's a Spanish teacher, it's not racist to ask for proof, okay? You ignore your mother's voice and get right into that horse's mouth.</p>
<p>So if Chang's a fraud, what about our grades? Are they invalid? Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>That's not fair to you guys.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've all worked very hard and learned.</p>
<p>So just take your final with Chang's replacement.</p>
<p>Doctor.</p>
<p>Sí.</p>
<p>Buenos días.</p>
<p>Sí.</p>
<p>Listen to this back and forth.</p>
<p>It's like I'm at an embassy.</p>
<p>What's on the final? I know it's in Spanish, dummy.</p>
<p>What chapters? All three or? Veinte.</p>
<p>Oh, I know that one.</p>
<p>She wants a large coffee.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>She's thinking.</p>
<p>Okay, in English.</p>
<p>You will be taking a standard exam for students at your level.</p>
<p>It will cover this entire textbook.</p>
<p>El crappo.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand a word Dr. Escodera was saying.</p>
<p>And why is she teaching Spanish if she's a doctor? Go cure something.</p>
<p>I gotta pass that exam or my entire four-year plan will be thrown off.</p>
<p>That might be your car, Jeff.</p>
<p>What? My route for the 4th of July, fireworks set off the car alarms.</p>
<p>That one sounded like a new Lexus.</p>
<p>My Lexus isn't brand-new.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Yours is a 2002.</p>
<p>That's the year I heard it.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>You two-faced jag.</p>
<p>You're wearing protective goggles to destroy my car? Safety first.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>I ask you for help and you turn me in? What? I did not.</p>
<p>Why would I screw myself? What am I, Dr. Drew? I didn't do it, okay? Then tell me who did it so I can murder your face.</p>
<p>Hey, break it up.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, oh.</p>
<p>We're writing a song.</p>
<p>For the battle of bands.</p>
<p>Good luck passing your exam, Winger.</p>
<p>At one point, I was teaching you Klingon.</p>
<p>Yeah? Why don't you tell that to your really weird-sounding magical chair.</p>
<p>I have a condition.</p>
<p>I'm peeing.</p>
<p>I'm peeing.</p>
<p>I'm peeing.</p>
<p>Impressive.</p>
<p>I dismantled that valve and I put out that free cake because I wanted to see what you could do.</p>
<p>You got a gift, kid.</p>
<p>You know that, right? A gift for sinks.</p>
<p>Big deal.</p>
<p>I'm a student.</p>
<p>I like learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Learning.</p>
<p>Learn everything.</p>
<p>Learn until you're dead.</p>
<p>Or you can call this number.</p>
<p>Now, that's a company that fixes toilets and sinks.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Listen to me.</p>
<p>Toilets and sinks, real things, things that people always use and always need to get fixed.</p>
<p>This is a life, kid, a real one.</p>
<p>Doing something that matters, something that makes sense.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes sense is this.</p>
<p>Learning, thoughts.</p>
<p>So I can think, and get a student loan, and grind my own coffee, and understand HBO.</p>
<p>You don't have to do that, kid.</p>
<p>You're special.</p>
<p>You could be a plumber.</p>
<p>You could be a plumber.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Okay, so we know three kinds of verbs, which took 40 minutes.</p>
<p>At this rate, if we don't sleep or pee, we can cover about 10 percent of the exam.</p>
<p>If it's multiple choice, Actually, that's a lot of right answers when you're guessing almost everything.</p>
<p>I don't wanna sound like a defeatist, but we're defeated.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Jeff.</p>
<p>Face it.</p>
<p>Why even take the exam? We're all gonna be retaking Spanish this fall.</p>
<p>What was that? What was what? I don't know.</p>
<p>I said retake Spanish and everyone went, "Ugh." </p>
<p>And you went, "Hmm." </p>
<p>It's one of those recessive genes.</p>
<p>I can also curl my tongue.</p>
<p>Who else? Annie ratted out Chang.</p>
<p>What? You made this happen because you're obsessed with all of us being together next year.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I was obsessed.</p>
<p>Permission to treat witness hostile? I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Did you record yesterday's Spanish class? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Abed? You said you record all your classes.</p>
<p>Pierce called it a spoiler alert.</p>
<p>You heard Chang tell me he was bogus.</p>
<p>And then dropped the dime because you would do anything to keep this group together, because you are insecure.</p>
<p>Because you didn't get hot until after high school.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>For real, Annie? Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>Make her a dude so I can punch her.</p>
<p>Go ahead and hate me.</p>
<p>We were all gonna drift apart.</p>
<p>You were all too cool to do anything.</p>
<p>Maybe not too cool, maybe just, you know, not psycho enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little crazy.</p>
<p>A little psycho.</p>
<p>Now she is going to make the Disney face.</p>
<p>Her lip is gonna quiver and her eyes will flutter, but they won't ever actually close.</p>
<p>But do not feel sorry for her.</p>
<p>She stole a year of our lives, and we're right to be pissed.</p>
<p>Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Everyone close their eyes.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>Close them.</p>
<p>Abed, close.</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry about me.</p>
<p>I can only connect with people through movies.</p>
<p>She's the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p>You guys, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I only did it so that we could stay friends.</p>

<p>What's an avatar? Okay.</p>
<p>Nature sounds or not, we're not gonna have trouble passing our Spanish final.</p>
<p>I've transcribed this semester's notes from my digital recorder.</p>
<p>You record every class? Pfft.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>You mean nerd alert.</p>
<p>Alert nerd.</p>
<p>Here's a spoiler.</p>
<p>We're all gonna spend the next three days boning up.</p>
<p>Then pass the exam and move on to Spanish 103.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good ending, Annie.</p>
<p>Except for where I take Spanish 103.</p>
<p>What do you mean? Spanish 102 fills my language requirement.</p>
<p>I guess I just figured we're a Spanish study group, so we'd keep taking Spanish together.</p>
<p>That's what I thought too, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>I'm on a tight, four-year schedule to replace my bachelor's.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna take an extra class.</p>
<p>Spanish has value beyond credit.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I know the family downstairs hates me.</p>
<p>I don't need to understand why.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>You want me to say it? I'll say it.</p>
<p>I like this group.</p>

<p>Oh, I think so too.</p>

<p>And they have a class at noon.</p>
<p>Noon, everybody.</p>
<p>Anthropology? Anthropology? Anthropology? Annie, I'm not big on planning ahead, but I have one unmovable appointment May 23rd, 2013.</p>
<p>To buy a flying car? I have a table for one at Morty's Steakhouse where I will celebrate becoming a lawyer again which can only happen if I take a full load.</p>
<p>Don't.</p>
<p>A full load of classes every year, I can maybe make it until then.</p>
<p>But not by building my schedule around BFFs.</p>
<p>We'll build ours around yours.</p>
<p>Annie, you realize we'll be friends whether or not we have a class together, right? Of course you think that.</p>
<p>Obvious from your name your parents smoked pot.</p>

<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Save the judgment, Winger, all right? If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.</p>
<p>That was the chair.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>It's unsolvable.</p>

<p>I don't wanna sound like a defeatist, but we're defeated.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Jeff.</p>
<p>Face it.</p>
<p>Why even take the exam? We're all gonna be retaking Spanish this fall.</p>
<p>What was that? What was what? I don't know.</p>
<p>I said retake Spanish and everyone went, "Ugh." </p>
<p>And you went, "Hmm." </p>
<p>It's one of those recessive genes.</p>
<p>I can also curl my tongue.</p>
<p>Who else? Annie ratted out Chang.</p>
<p>What? You made this happen because you're obsessed with all of us being together next year.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I was obsessed.</p>
<p>Permission to treat witness hostile? I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Did you record yesterday's Spanish class? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Abed? You said you record all your classes.</p>
<p>Pierce called it a spoiler alert.</p>
<p>You heard Chang tell me he was bogus.</p>
<p>And then dropped the dime because you would do anything to keep this group together, because you are insecure.</p>
<p>Because you didn't get hot until after high school.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>For real, Annie? Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>Make her a dude so I can punch her.</p>
<p>Go ahead and hate me.</p>
<p>We were all gonna drift apart.</p>
<p>You were all too cool to do anything.</p>
<p>Maybe not too cool, maybe just, you know, not psycho enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little crazy.</p>
<p>A little psycho.</p>
<p>Now she is going to make the Disney face.</p>
<p>Her lip is gonna quiver and her eyes will flutter, but they won't ever actually close.</p>
<p>But do not feel sorry for her.</p>
<p>She stole a year of our lives, and we're right to be pissed.</p>
<p>Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Everyone close their eyes.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>Close them.</p>
<p>Abed, close.</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry about me.</p>
<p>I can only connect with people through movies.</p>
<p>She's the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p>You guys, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I only did it so that we could stay friends.</p>
<p>Picture her as Paul Giamatti.</p>
<p>I mean, he's -- heh.</p>
<p>Friends don't do what you did to us.</p>
<p>Did the sisterhood of the traveling pants poison each other's food so they were too sick to leave? No.</p>
<p>I've never seen it, but I'm pretty sure they mailed each other pants.</p>
<p>I said I was sorry.</p>
<p>Who cares if you're sorry? We're still screwed.</p>
<p>Be sorry about this stuff before you do it.</p>
<p>Then don't do it.</p>
<p>It's called growing up.</p>
<p>We were gonna see each other all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what my rehab group used to say.</p>
<p>The only one that keeps in touch is the guy that sells jewelry made out of bottle caps.</p>
<p>I had hoped that this group would amount to more than passing hellos and whatever the hell this is.</p>
<p>Nobody even think about going after her.</p>
<p>That's what she wants, more personal drama so we fail the exam and stay in Spanish forever.</p>
<p>We have to beat her.</p>
<p>Don't text her.</p>
<p>Don't call her.</p>
<p>Don't mention her.</p>
<p>We do not need her to study.</p>
<p>Does anybody know how to study? Annie usually Whose side are you on? Happy finals week, Greendale.</p>
<p>Continuing our stress-reducing nature sounds, that's cut five from Sounds of the Serengeti.</p>
<p>Here's a B-side from that album, "Antelope Slaughter at Ndutu." </p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Did we miss the exam? No, it starts in 40 minutes.</p>
<p>I can't wake up Pierce.</p>
<p>Is this gonna take an unexpected turn? You have to know how to do it.</p>
<p>Discrimination lawsuit.</p>
<p>Preposterous.</p>
<p>Should we call Annie? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes on the prize and let her grow up.</p>
<p>I'll see you all at the exam.</p>
<p>Wait for me, Britta.</p>
<p>I was with you in the bathroom.</p>
<p>You're with me everywhere.</p>
<p>Troy, I know you could be a plumber.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna be, okay? I'm gonna be sophisticated and have no job, or a job that looks from a distance like I do nothing.</p>
<p>Troy, you know what the best part of my day is? Ten seconds from the time I sit in Spanish to the time I look at your desk.</p>
<p>Because I think maybe I'll look and he won't be there.</p>
<p>Between our studying for 12 hours, and Pierce being asleep for 11, I think we may actually stand a chance.</p>
<p>My horoscope predicted suffering.</p>
<p>No, no, that's good.</p>
<p>Horoscopes are the devil trying to trick us.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That make you happy? Why aren't you at your desk? Because I don't wanna sit near you because you're a bad friend.</p>
<p>He said the best part of his day is when he thinks I won't be there.</p>
<p>Abed, what a terrible thing to say.</p>
<p>It's from a movie.</p>
<p>Then the movie it's from is terrible.</p>
<p>Where's Annie? Oh, I sent her a text, but she hasn't responded yet.</p>
<p>Shirley, what did I tell you? Don't play into her ploy for attention.</p>
<p>What does it say? She says she's fine and this isn't a ploy for attention.</p>
<p>She's sorry.</p>
<p>She does need to grow up, starting by making things right with Chang.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>What? He'll kill her.</p>
<p>Who cares about a stupid exam? We're a study group.</p>
<p>And Annie's our friend.</p>
<p>I'm friends with Hannah too.</p>
<p>The whole class is.</p>
<p>And you can't have an exam without a class.</p>
<p>Right, guys? We love Hannah.</p>
<p>We love Hannah.</p>
<p>We love Hannah.</p>
<p>We love Hannah.</p>
<p>No! No! Oh, no.</p>
<p>The devil told the truth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Winger, what the hell? What was that screaming? I was showing Annie the magic of electronic sampling.</p>
<p>We thought you were murdering her.</p>
<p>Annie getting me fired was the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>She's helping me re-plan my life.</p>
<p>She's got a real mind for stuff like this.</p>
<p>We're gonna find Ben a job so he can stay at Greendale as a student and work on his teaching degree.</p>
<p>And music classes, you know? Maybe get the band back together, huh? Oh.</p>
<p>Listen to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Music lessons would be great for you.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, Britta.</p>
<p>Now, go pass that test.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Well, it was kind of easy, right? Yeah, I think I might have passed.</p>
<p>Jeff, I can never forgive myself for what I did.</p>
<p>Look, I treated you like a child for having feelings.</p>
<p>Maybe because that's, you know, when I stopped having them.</p>
<p>But you shouldn't.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a kid to admit that you like people.</p>
<p>And you don't have to dress like this to grow up.</p>
<p>You look like a travel agent.</p>
<p>You don't like it? I was going for more of a professor thing.</p>
<p>What? Why? What? Nothing.</p>
<p>I think I got half of it, which got me through the half I didn't.</p>
<p>Like the first season of <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>The Wire</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414'>The Wire</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>2002&ndash;2008</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Exactly the --</p>
<p>Ah, hell, I can't stay mad at you.</p>
<p>I think I nailed it.</p>
<p>Oh, me too.</p>
<p>I'm feeling pretty confident.</p>
<p>I think we're gonna make it.</p>
<p>Still, we should plan for the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Because if we do all pass, that means next year, we won't have a class together.</p>
<p>So we're gonna need a backup.</p>
<p>Anthropology? Anthropology? Anthropology? Anthropology? Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Anthropology.</p>
<p>Anthropology.</p>
<p>I want you to be in my next film.</p>

<p>Bennett, Shirley: 81.</p>
<p>Edison, Annie: 95.</p>
<p>Hawthorne, Pierce: 70.</p>
<p>Nadir, Abed: 85.</p>
<p>Perry, Britta: 79.</p>
<p>Winger, Jeff--</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Jeff.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the half-hearted mislead, 80.</p>
<p>We all pass Spanish.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Not to take anything away from anyone, but didn't the test seem extra easy? I don't know.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks for making it easy.</p>
<p>I was going to say the same to you, but you were gone before breakfast.</p>
<p>I'm an early riser.</p>
<p>I'll say.</p>
