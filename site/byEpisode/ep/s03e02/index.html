<p>By the end of WWII President Roosevelt had finally succumbed to the polio that afflicted him his entire life.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the Yalta Conference.</p>
<p>Who can tell me three key points brought up there? Annie.</p>
<p>The demilitarization of Germany-- I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Annie Kim.</p>
<p>The demilitarization of Germany, the establishment of Poland's borders and the formation of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Side note: The results of Yalta would later set the stage for the Cold War.</p>
<p>Oh, boy, spoiler alert.</p>
<p>Somebody just won a ride in the wheelchair.</p>
<p>I'm proud of you for deciding on a major, Britta.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank the lord in my prayers about you, but you're still dressing like a streetwalker.</p>
<p>Yep, I'm getting serious.</p>
<p>I got a backpack, I got a new notebook.</p>
<p>Oh, I got one of those see-through yellow pens so I can do that thing where you color in the words.</p>
<p>Highlight? Probably the backpack.</p>
<p>Free the damascus three.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, whoa.</p>
<p>I know this girl.</p>
<p>We used to protest together all the time and now she's locked up in Syria.</p>
<p>Oh, that's terrible.</p>
<p>Yes, it's terrible.</p>
<p>She's imprisoned by an oppressive regime halfway around the world and I'm, what? In college? Where are my values? Man, she's got a Facebook group? My first cop flashlight.</p>
<p>Can't wait to get some brains on this bad boy.</p>
<p>Are you safe, ma'am? Everything okay? Is this guy bothering you? - Huh? Huh? - Hey! Who the hell do you think you are? The badge says to serve and protect! No, it doesn't.</p>
<p>"How's my smile?" Oh, man.</p>
<p>What the hell am I in charge of? See this garbage can? Students coming out of the library bump into it.</p>
<p>You can serve and protect them from a nasty boo-boo.</p>
<p>What do I do if I see a crime? What a security guard does-- Call a cop.</p>
<p>Where'd you even get these? - Come on, let me keep them.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Please? I swear they're just for sex!</p>
<p>And this ragtag group of cut-ups is my study group.</p>
<p>Gang, this is Annie Kim from my Poli-Sci class.</p>
<p>We just figured out we had the same G.P.A. in high school.</p>
<p>Well, mine was higher if you consider my school's ranking.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like you had a lighter course load, so.</p>
<p>Well, I was in a lot of clubs.</p>
<p>I founded 17 of them.</p>
<p>Well, I was actually thinking about founding a model U.N. here at Greendale.</p>
<p>Any interest? I'll probably be busy, and you probably need to study, so see you in class.</p>
<p>Okay, goodbye.</p>
<p>Wow, Annie.</p>
<p>How progressive of you to have a multicultural evil twin.</p>
<p>An Asian Annie.</p>
<p>Obama's America.</p>
<p>Her name is Annie Kim, and she's not evil.</p>
<p>She's my friend.</p>
<p>Didn't look like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you seemed pretty competitive with her.</p>
<p>You be careful, Annie.</p>
<p>They are ruthless.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What? Not Asians.</p>
<p>Women.</p>
<p>I'm not competing with her.</p>
<p>I find her adorable.</p>
<p>She's like a younger me.</p>
<p>You mean the younger you that took so much Adderall she tried to straighten the lines on our high school football field during a game? Ooh, be careful, Annie.</p>
<p>You don't want this little girl to suck you back to the dark side.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, what're you trying to do here? This is our Annie.</p>
<p>That little twerp is a can of Annie lite.</p>
<p>She couldn't hold a candle to the real thing in any category of anything.</p>
<p>Aw, well, I wasn't fishing for that.</p>
<p>You're the best, kiddo.</p>
<p>You know what else was the best? The rainforests.</p>
<p>Too bad the fascist oligarchies are raping them to make hamburgers.</p>
<p>Look it up.</p>
<p>Looks like someone woke up on the regular side of the bed.</p>
<p>Britta's just having a rough time because her friend's in prison.</p>
<p>I went to her Facebook page.</p>
<p>It says she was tear-gassed and possibly beaten.</p>
<p>I haven't been tear-gassed in so long.</p>
<p>Well, you're on a new path now.</p>
<p>Oh, goody, a new path.</p>
<p>Is it lined with credit cards and flat screen TVs? Does it go by an Ikea? Maybe I don't want a new path! Or any path.</p>
<p>Maybe my path is a war path that leads to the terrordome, n-words! Okay, maybe I went too far.</p>
<p>Maybe I don't want to offend my African-American friends, but the larger point is, maybe I'm not done raging against the machine.</p>
<p>Raging against the what? That sounds dangerous.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>She'll be bad at it.</p>
<p>Keep clear of the can.</p>
<p>Sir, step around the can.</p>
<p>Mind the can, student.</p>
<p># Hello #</p>
<p># Is it me you're looking for #</p>
<p># I can see it in your eyes #</p>
<p>You just got yourself a warning.</p>
<p>I piss warnings, pig.</p>
<p>You're all I ever wanted.</p>
<p>And that's how we do that.</p>
<p>Hey! I got my eye on you, missy.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You okay, kiddo? Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know what's funny? This is so silly.</p>
<p>Remember little Annie Kim from Poli-Sci? Boy, she just took my model U.N. idea and just -</p>
<p>She is quite the little go-getter.</p>
<p>Wait, what? She stole your idea? Sneak attack.</p>
<p>That's just like-- Not women, Asians.</p>
<p>Well, the real important thing is that there is a model U.N.</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter who starts it.</p>
<p>It just means her name goes on some charter and she gets to put it on her résumé.</p>
<p>And lead the Greendale team to the national model U.N., and meet Kofi Annan, Boutros Boutros Ghali, and Will.I.Am.</p>
<p>Boutros Boutros Ghali? I'm gonna find this little brat's off-switch.</p>
<p>Jeff! He's just being protective.</p>
<p>I'll stop him.</p>
<p>I am so excited that we finally have a model U.N. here at Greendale.</p>
<p>I am really, really, really, really, really, really into model U.N.s.</p>
<p>They used to call me model U.N. guy back in college.</p>
<p>Well, that's not-- don't research that.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that I am really-- </p>
<p>Pardon me, Professor Cligoris.</p>
<p>Cligoris? Either pronunciation is fine? </p>
<p>Are you here for the model U.N.? </p>
<p>I'm here to tell you that the entire idea to have a model U.N. was hers.</p>
<p>Really? So you're Clark M. Eichelburger.</p>
<p>So I've had your photo around my neck since I was in high school.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the Greendale model U.N.</p>
<p>My Annie gave this other Annie the idea and the diabolical little busybody stabbed her in the back.</p>
<p>It's childish.</p>
<p>Honestly I'm just happy there is a model U.N.</p>
<p>Annie, is this true? I recall other Annie mentioned the concept, but she certainly didn't take the initiative to find a faculty advisor.</p>
<p>I didn't know that all you had to do was call dibs.</p>
<p>I'm not calling dibs.</p>
<p>Because I'm not a petty competitive child that steals ideas.</p>
<p>I simply refuse to acknowledge the authority of your criminal model U.N.</p>
<p>So don't recognize it.</p>
<p>It still exists.</p>
<p>Oh, then Annie'll just start her own model U.N.</p>
<p>Yeah, for grown-ups.</p>
<p>Well, I still don't recognize it.</p>
<p>Well, it exists, baby! I'm sorry, I don't understand your relationship here.</p>
<p>Is he your father or your lover? -</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>There can only be one model U.N. that officially represents this school so let's take our foot off the crazy pedal for just a moment here.</p>
<p>There's only one rational way to settle this.</p>
<p>A head-to-head model U.N. Battle Royale, the rules to which I would have to spend the evening devising.</p>
<p>We'll have the competition tomorrow in the cafeteria at 7:00 P.M.</p>
<p>May the most United Nations win.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Totally fair.</p>
<p>I'll see you in the fair papers, other Annie.</p>
<p>Oh, and you were asking what our relationship is? - We're friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good friends.</p>
<p>Grown-up friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>We're friendly.</p>
<p>So, the key to winning this thing is when in doubt, agree with Annie.</p>
<p>That's sweet, Jeff.</p>
<p>But everyone should just have fun.</p>
<p>Then again, what's more fun than winning?</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>I'm offended you would single me out.</p>
<p>Did you read up on your country's info-packet? Yes.</p>
<p>Somalia has 1,900 miles of coastline, a government that knows its place, and all the guns and wives you can afford to buy.</p>
<p>Why have I never heard of this paradise before? I studied up on my country.</p>
<p>Is it okay if we do accents, sugar? Troy, Georgia the country, not the state.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Capital city Tbilisi, and former member of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And we kindly request y'all mind your Ps and Qs.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world's first ever model U.N.-off.</p>
<p>You will each be scored on your U.N.'s ability to pass resolutions, follow procedure, and maintain order.</p>
<p>The end goal, of course, total world peace.</p>
<p>Any questions? Does two U.N.s mean there are two earths? Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Sure, two earths.</p>
<p>Parallel earths in different galaxies or identical earths in parallel dimensions? The latter one.</p>
<p>Well, what does that say about free will? Abed! Professor-- Right, yeah, let's begin.</p>
<p>Ready, set, peace.</p>
<p>Crisis alert.</p>
<p>A civil war has broken out in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Rebel forces have seized the grain supply, creating a humanitarian disaster.</p>
<p>Okay, cool heads, everyone.</p>
<p>America proposes a U.N. peacekeeping force of Uruguay agrees.</p>
<p>Ooh, uh, China, too.</p>
<p>Georgia--the country-- is much obliged.</p>
<p>There's gonna be refugees.</p>
<p>Who can take refugees? The great country of Somalia.</p>
<p>This gem, this Shangri-La graciously invites the Ethiopian refugees to enjoy safe lodging and cool ocean breezes on its sand-swept beaches.</p>
<p>Okay, we're rolling.</p>
<p>Switzerland proposes a peace summit.</p>
<p>Good idea, Switzerland.</p>
<p>And maybe at the peace summit we can discuss the possibility of opening a portal to Earth II.</p>
<p>Can we put a pin in that, Switzerland? Earth II is out there, can't ignore it forever.</p>
<p>Well, China has money.</p>
<p>Does anybody want some? Yes! The United States proposes using China's money to fund agricultural programs to support Ethiopia's sustainable farms.</p>
<p>Which should promote economic development and security.</p>
<p>All in favor? It's unanimous.</p>
<p>Good resolving, blue U.N.</p>
<p>You really covered all the bases.</p>
<p>We have a unanimous decision as well.</p>
<p>Then after one round, we are tied.</p>
<p>Looks like both U.N.s are experts at fostering unity.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Crisis alert.</p>
<p>Russia This is what the United Nations is doing to your freedom.</p>
<p>I'm your freedom! And I'm in a cage.</p>
<p>With the world! Because of them! I thought I'd find you here.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do, lock me up? Just give me a reason.</p>
<p>I'll give you a reason!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>That's it, you're coming with me.</p>
<p>Hello   is it me you're looking for  He's pulling my cage.</p>
<p>I'm being pulled in my cage for no reason! Is anybody seeing this? Is the world seeing this? Are we facebooking this? Crisis alert! A tsunami has hit Vietnam.</p>
<p>Massive--crisis alert, famine in Ghana-- crisis alert--tuberculosis outbreak--crisis alert! Humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>We further resolve-- - Disarmament treaty.</p>
<p>Crisis alert! To help women and children get through famines.</p>
<p>Save the orphans.</p>
<p>Loose nukes-- sinkhole-- North Korea-- the prime minister in exile! Military coup! The tropical paradise of Somalia graciously yields.</p>
<p>China will pay.</p>
<p>Gooder than grits.</p>
<p>Switzerland is very concerned about Earth II.</p>
<p>Uruguay agrees.</p>
<p>Uruguay sounds like "you're a gay." </p>
<p>Backyard barbecue! Uruguay kindly requests that Somalia stop pronouncing it "you're a gay." </p>
<p>Hereditary monarchy! - Resolved.</p>
<p>Graft and corruption.</p>
<p>Resolved.</p>
<p>Crisis alert! All: Resolved.</p>
<p>Looking good, blue U.N.</p>
<p>Getting very close to world peace.</p>
<p>That's my girl.</p>
<p>You are kicking ass.</p>
<p>All right, guys, this is the home stretch.</p>
<p>All we gotta do is focus.</p>
<p>Oh! Damn, Pierce.</p>
<p>Ooh, that wasn't me.</p>
<p>I don't smell anything-- whup, I just got it.</p>
<p>Oh, it's in my mouth.</p>
<p>Guys, come on, focus.</p>
<p>Like adults.</p>
<p>We're gonna lose a point if we don't get through this.</p>
<p>Get through it? It's almost a solid.</p>
<p>Crisis alert.</p>
<p>A genocidal dictator in Laos-- Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that.</p>
<p>Okay, so, looking at Turkey, what can you do? So let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You're bringing her in here for "making a mess." </p>
<p>I did more than make a mess.</p>
<p>I turned your whole system inside out.</p>
<p>And I shut her down.</p>
<p>Young lady, you spilled paint on a globe.</p>
<p>You're as much a criminal as this idiot is a cop.</p>
<p>None whatsoever.</p>
<p>Okay, but, um, she's going to do something illegal.</p>
<p>Aren't you? Is that true? Do you, Britta Perry, have any intentions of breaking any laws ever? I-I- Oh, my God.</p>
<p>No, it's not that simple.</p>
<p>I have a life now.</p>
<p>I have a major and-- Get out please.</p>
<p>I have highlighters.</p>
<p>Get out! Okay, I know you've got a lot on your mind right now.</p>
<p>But somebody broke that thing that comes down from the parking booth.</p>
<p>You know the thing that comes down, keeps thecars from coming in.</p>
<p>The thing.</p>
<p>It's like a gate, but it's just a stick.</p>
<p>Comes down, from a hinge.</p>
<p>Keeps the cars out.</p>
<p>Goes up and down 90 degrees.</p>
<p>The arm?</p>
<p>Ooh, point goes to red team.</p>
<p>How is this still happening? I can't remember what regular air smells like.</p>
<p>Do something or we're gonna lose.</p>
<p>Guys, this is important to Annie.</p>
<p>So whoever actually died a few months ago, 'fess up so we can put a stake through your heart.</p>
<p>Jeff! Annie, I think the real lesson here is that a model U.N., much like the real U.N., quickly falls apart when faced with actual-- </p>
<p>Noooooo! I think the lesson here is that I need to win this! I want to win! And you! You suck! You're a stupid, ugly poopface! I'm better than you! Annie, stop.</p>
<p>You're acting like a little schoolgirl and not in a hot way.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, that made me sound creepy.</p>
<p>But--but here's the thing.</p>
<p>Don't look at me.</p>
<p>If embarrassment were bountiful zinc deposits, I'd be Zambia.</p>
<p>There's nothing to be Zambia about, Annie.</p>
<p>This is all my fault.</p>
<p>I pushed you into competing with other Annie.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? I practically ran to you with that flier.</p>
<p>I wanted to destroy her.</p>
<p>All because I can't handle the thought of anyone getting more gold stars than me.</p>
<p>I'm such a child.</p>
<p>You're not.</p>
<p>Listen, when you really hate someone the way you hate Annie Kim, or when you feel the way I feel about you, the easy loophole through the creepiness and danger is to treat them like a child.</p>
<p>"A chip off the old block, you're the best, kiddo." </p>
<p>It's a crutch.</p>
<p>It's a way for me to tell you how important you are from a distance.</p>
<p>But now you're becoming this mature, self-possessed, intelligent young woman, and I can't keep patting you on the head or talking down to you.</p>
<p>But I like how close we are.</p>
<p>I don't want to grow up if it means losing what we have.</p>
<p>Well, tough, Annie.</p>
<p>You have to grow up because the world needs more women like you.</p>
<p>Can't keep doing this forever, kiddo.</p>
<p>Can't we? - Nope.</p>
<p>I can't, no.</p>
<p>Nope, that's gross.</p>
<p>That feels gross.</p>
<p>Well, I better go check on the group.</p>
<p>If they haven't left already.</p>
<p>I'll follow you.</p>
<p>From a respectable distance.</p>
<p>Guys? I'm sorry I put you through that.</p>
<p>And I know it doesn't make up for what happened, but would it help if I said I farted? Annie, no.</p>
<p>I can't let you fall on that sword because I farted.</p>
<p>No, I farted.</p>
<p>I farted.</p>
<p>Guys, I wasn't doing the Spartacus thing.</p>
<p>I farted.</p>
<p>No, seriously, I-- We all farted.</p>
<p>Oh, you guys! - Annie - I'm farting now.</p>
<p>Wait, why are you still here? Abed may have figured out a way we can still win.</p>
<p>Really? How? It's simple, really.</p>
<p>First we -</p>
<p>Abed, what did I tell you? You can't just mumble nonsense.</p>
<p>No one's cutting away.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, here's my actual plan.</p>
<p>What is that? It's from Britta.</p>
<p>She's promising to disrupt the model U.N.</p>
<p>She says she's gonna cause a disruption that, while not completely illegal, should be a real concern to campus security! Oh, no.</p>
<p>Maybe we should call the real cops.</p>
<p>You know, back in the '80s, I had this real piece of work protestor, used to always give me trouble.</p>
<p>You know what happened to her? She incited a riot at the W.T.O.</p>
<p>Got choked until she passed out.</p>
<p>By some real cop with a real billyclub.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder, you know? Well, what are you waiting for? Go show that hippie how the world really works.</p>
<p>Aren't you forgetting something? All in favor? Aye? Could you morons say aye any slower? Come on.</p>
<p>Greetings, people of Earth II.</p>
<p>What is this? We represent the United Nations from Earth I.</p>
<p>Using our Switzerland's hadron collider and resources from every nation, the people of our planet have constructed a trans-dimensional gateway here.</p>
<p>They can't do this.</p>
<p>The science works out.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We come to you with an offer.</p>
<p>We he achieved world peace, tying our score with yours.</p>
<p>But we are willing to concede our victory if you agree conceding yours, forming one gigantic United United Nations.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>You're a fool.</p>
<p>Your ultimatum is itself a technical act of aggression.</p>
<p>If we simply refuse to recognize your authority, we still remain ahead and you lose.</p>
<p>But you win a simple game.</p>
<p>The larger symbolic victory will be ours.</p>
<p>Oh la la.</p>
<p>We refuse.</p>
<p>I'll take the real victory.</p>
<p>A logical, effective, common sense move, Annie Kim.</p>
<p>One which flies in the very face of the United Nations itself, a fundamentally symbolic organization founded on the principles of high-minded rhetoric and empty gestures.</p>
<p>Blue U.N. wins.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing? Nothing.</p>
<p>And you can't do anything to stop me.</p>
<p>Did someone say "can't do anything"?</p>
<p># Hello #</p>
<p># Is it me you're looking for #</p>
<p># I can see it in your eyes #</p>
<p># I can see it in your smile #</p>
<p># You're all I've ever wanted #</p>
<p># And my arms are open wide #</p>
<p># 'Cause you know just what to say #</p>
<p># And you know just what to do #</p>
<p>Oh, that's-- that's nice.</p>
<p>No?  And I want to tell you so much, I knew you'd come.</p>
<p>You're so busted.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I told you to stop playing Operation on me! I'm not your damn board game! At least you didn't get my spare ribs.</p>
<p></p>
