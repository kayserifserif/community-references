<p>We are so screwed.</p>
<p>How are we gonna memorize all this? Let's just go over it again.</p>
<p>Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.</p>
<p>I use a mnemonic device.</p>
<p>"Kevin, please come over for gay sex." </p>
<p>Why wouldn't you use "Karen"? 'Cause it's gay sex, dummy.</p>
<p>So use "great".</p>
<p>Now I can't remember anything.</p>
<p>Thanks! God, why do we always wind up in this position? For all the time you spend here, you'd think we wouldn't have to cram so much.</p>
<p>Maybe we never get any work done because we have so much fun hanging out together.</p>
<p>Definitely, maybe that's why.</p>
<p>Ah, the duali-Dean of man.</p>
<p>I'm dressed this way because I have good news and bad news.</p>
<p>You have got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>The bad news is Professor Kane has the flu.</p>
<p>The good news is biology class is canceled. </p>
<p>After you.</p>
<p>What a gentleman.</p>
<p>Guys, we don't have to cram last minute anymore.</p>
<p>Last minute got moved to tomorrow.</p>
<p>Three-hour lunch? Three-hour lunch? Three-hour lunch? Three hours? I could watch the first half of three movies.</p>
<p>Ooh, I don't have to go to the fast food restaurant across the street.</p>
<p>I can go to the fancy one across town.</p>
<p>Their manager wears a tie.</p>
<p>If we don't eat, we can make-believe an whole episode's worth of Inspector Spacetime - in the Dreamatorium.</p>
<p>Word.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe we should go to Señor Kevin's.</p>
<p>Britta, didn't you want to try that new cage-free bean burrito? The tortillas are made with micro-financed flour.</p>
<p>Troy, you could drive.</p>
<p>You always like that spiral parking ramp.</p>
<p>You just keep turning left, but you end up up! I can't go to Señor Kevin's.</p>
<p>The manager and I are enemies.</p>
<p>He said Die Hard was bad.</p>
<p>He said Die Hard was bad.</p>
<p>I know, buddy.</p>
<p>Well, how about this.</p>
<p>This lunch is already a runaway train, no point in stopping it.</p>
<p>Troy, Britta, you go to Señor Kevin's.</p>
<p>Abed promised he'd show me how the Dreamatorium works.</p>
<p>Today's the perfect day for it.</p>
<p>But I want to Abed, don't you think today's - the perfect day for it? - No.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Is this a social cue? I left my Puttin' on the Ritz cane in here earlier.</p>
<p>I know it probably has another name, but, um, can I be perfectly honest with you guys? I think I went too far with this one.</p>
<p>I have to go to the bank today.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to tell people in line? "I had good news and bad news"? Come on, Craig.</p>
<p>Get your life together.</p>
<p>I am Inspector Spacetime.</p>
<p>And I know that which is unknown.</p>
<p>Duty-bound to protect a universe of innocent unremarkables, I patrol it in the x7 Dimensionizer with my loyal constable, Reggie.</p>
<p>This week, however, Reggie has been forced to go to lunch.</p>
<p>So I'm aboard the much crappier H.M.S. Spacetime 12, from the worst season ever, with temporary constable, Geneva.</p>
<p>Geneva, I need the quantum spanner, the big one.</p>
<p>Oi, gov'ner, quantum spammer, up an' at 'em, in'it? If we can't get out of orbital lock, the Blorgons may intercept.</p>
<p>Tut tut, m'lord.</p>
<p>Wouldn't give a tuppence for that sticky wicket.</p>
<p>Okay, stop simulation.</p>
<p>More British? I can't do this anymore.</p>
<p>But the Blo-gons might intercept It's Blorgons with an "r".</p>
<p>Blo-gon means "thank you" in blorgon.</p>
<p>Can't we play something I know about like hospital administration? You're mad at me for playing matchmaker with Troy and Britta.</p>
<p>You think you're gonna lose Troy.</p>
<p>I'm not petty, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm mad at you because you tampered with the fabric of the group.</p>
<p>How do you know Troy and Britta pairing up wouldn't destroy everything? I run the scenarios.</p>
<p>I examine this stuff from every conceivable angle.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can do that but I can't? You don't have a patent on being a control freak, Abed.</p>
<p>I kind of do.</p>
<p>You think this is just a room where Troy and I play dinosaurs versus river boat gamblers together? Sure, it's how I got the construction approved, but, much like myself, the Dreamatorium has higher functions.</p>
<p>Would you like me to show you how your stunt with Troy and Britta will play itself out? Why not? Execute simulation Troy/Britta.</p>
<p>Render environment Señor Kevin's.</p>
<p>Oh, those appetizers were dope and legit! I don't usually support lunch because it's unfair to breakfast.</p>
<p>I never thought about meals fighting each other.</p>
<p>I guess that explains why you never see any two of them on the same table.</p>
<p>So I guess Annie's pretty hot to get us together.</p>
<p>She probably just doesn't understand people.</p>
<p>Well, the sooner the food comes, the sooner this will be over.</p>
<p>I'm afraid your food won't be ready for another half hour.</p>
<p>I'm too busy misunderstanding the whole point of Die Hard.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get home to Abed.</p>
<p>So you can dart back and forth doing impressions of your friends.</p>
<p>There's no science at work here.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>The science is at work in here.</p>
<p>This is the Dreamatorium's engine.</p>
<p>My thoughts are collected by this box and everything I know about my friends is stored here.</p>
<p>Both are distilled by logic and then recombined into objective observation.</p>
<p>I'm able to simulate any of the study group and even a half-accurate Chang in over 7,000 unique situations.</p>
<p>Abed, it's cardboard tubes and a funnel.</p>
<p>Well you see it that way because it's calibrated to a specific level of brain function.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I'm stupid.</p>
<p>Not stupid, just less able to see what I see.</p>
<p>Gee, you've got it all figured out.</p>
<p>King of toilet paper rolls over here.</p>
<p>Hey, Troy, I'm glad you called.</p>
<p>Your lunch is going well, right? Yeah, just checking on Abed.</p>
<p>Making sure he's okay.</p>
<p>What? He's fine.</p>
<p>He just implied I operate on a lower level of brain function, so business as usual.</p>
<p>Great, um, just, you know, make sure he stays comfortable.</p>
<p>I worry about him when I'm not around.</p>
<p>Well, he's fine, he always will be.</p>
<p>People bend over backwards to cater to him.</p>
<p>He's just extra sensitive in the Dreamatorium.</p>
<p>It takes a lot out of him to run that thing.</p>
<p>I don't want you to break his brain.</p>
<p>Bye, Troy.</p>
<p>How is he? - He'll be okay.</p>
<p>It's so sweet how much you care about him.</p>
<p>And another thing I hate about Die Hard, two FBI agents named Johnson.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about our Inspector Spacetime scenario.</p>
<p>It might work better if instead of playing Geneva, you played Rosamund.</p>
<p>She was a constable in season five and she only had three lines.</p>
<p>I have a better idea.</p>
<p>You know what would make your scenarios a lot more realistic? If Troy weren't on a date.</p>
<p>Why don't you take all your thoughts and your logic and add one step to the process.</p>
<p>What are you doing? - From now on, before you do or say anything, you're gonna think about how it affects the people around you.</p>
<p>We lower functioning brains call this "empathy".</p>
<p>Abed? Abed? Oh, my God, I broke Abed.</p>
<p>Abed? You know how you wanted me to tell you when you were being scary weird instead of cute weird? This is scary weird.</p>
<p>Hello, Annie.</p>
<p>What was I doing on the floor? Were we doing it? Are you being Jeff? Well, I'm not being a Kardashian.</p>
<p>So where are we now? We're in the doctor's lounge of Greendale Hospital School.</p>
<p>Hospital school? It's a sexy emotional school where doctors save lives and make love, often simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our stories, ripped from the headlines.</p>
<p>Our passions, unbridled.</p>
<p>Our cafeteria, eh...</p>
<p>Make love to me, Ann.</p>
<p>I know I'm just a surgeon and you're a hotshot upstart administrator, but damn the rules, damn the system, damn our two foot height disparity, I want you.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed, I get it, we have different sensibilities.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Okay, Dr. Jeff, can you please tell me where I can find Abed? I owe him an apology.</p>
<p>Abed? Never heard of him.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>I asked you a question, doctor.</p>
<p>I'm a surgeon! And I'm your administrator! I left my wife for you and she was pregnant! Who do you think inseminated her? Now tell me what I want to know or God as my witness, I'll have your stethoscope.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry might know.</p>
<p>Render environment bio lab.</p>
<p>Look, there's Britta and Troy fooling around with each other.</p>
<p>Look, there's Abed having overcome his issues.</p>
<p>Nice try.</p>
<p>Dr. Barnes, Dr. Perry.</p>
<p>We just saved an uninsured homeless man's life.</p>
<p>Using an unapproved procedure.</p>
<p>Now, we're going to kiss.</p>
<p>This is what you think I want? What do you want, administrator? I want to talk to Abed.</p>
<p>There's no one here by that name.</p>
<p>You're lying.</p>
<p>Maybe I am, so what? I was raised on the mean streets of Harlem.</p>
<p>I'm not scared of you.</p>
<p>Well, be scared of this.</p>
<p>Sodium pentothal, known commonly as truth serum.</p>
<p>I saw Abed's name in the hospital school files, I love butt stuff, I hate spiders, I stole a pen from the bank, I cried during About a Boy, the soundtrack, I don't wash my hands before surgery.</p>
<p>I can see why women find Clive Owen attractive to the point where I might just as well be attracted to him.</p>
<p>I use comparisons to Hitler to win arguments on the Internet at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>I know nothing about wine.</p>
<p>I'm more turned on by women in pajamas than lingerie.</p>
<p>I just want to know they feel comfortable.</p>
<p>I didn't get Inception.</p>
<p>I didn't get Inception.</p>
<p>You said you saw his name in the files.</p>
<p>There's so many layers.</p>
<p>Right, render environment medical study room.</p>
<p>There's head nurse, Shirley, talking to tragic, heart-wrenching Alzheimer's patient and Emmy-contender, Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawthorne, you're out of your bed again.</p>
<p>'Cause I think I'm on a train.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Shirley, get me the file on Abed.</p>
<p>Abed doesn't exist, young lady.</p>
<p>He exists if I say so.</p>
<p>This is my hospital school.</p>
<p>Your hospital school, young lady, is a simulation being run through a filter of other people's needs.</p>
<p>Abed's been filtered out because nobody needs him.</p>
<p>I need him.</p>
<p>Well you're not simulated.</p>
<p>No, but this is! Ooh! And there's more where that didn't come from.</p>
<p>This is a private compartment.</p>
<p>Jeff, get the files.</p>
<p>Why me? Because you can see the cabinets.</p>
<p>And I'll make love to you.</p>
<p>Jackpot.</p>
<p>There is an Abed in this hospital school, but he's not a doctor.</p>
<p>He's a patient.</p>
<p>Notify security! - Conductor! Jeff, take me to Abed.</p>
<p>Where is that? Enough games, just take me where I wanna go.</p>
<p>Follow me.</p>
<p>Are we close? Almost there, although you should probably run in place and let the hall move around you.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>Where? Where you wanted to go.</p>
<p>The last night of school, first year.</p>
<p>The night we kissed.</p>
<p>Abed wasn't there, so whose memory is this? Maybe it's yours.</p>
<p>Maybe the Dreamatorium really works.</p>
<p>Or maybe Leonard was watching from the bushes and told Abed about it.</p>
<p>I don't have cable.</p>
<p>Knock it off, Abed.</p>
<p>I'm not Abed.</p>
<p>You're confused, so was I.</p>
<p>But not anymore.</p>
<p>Jeff, Abed, stop! I don't wanna do this.</p>
<p>I want to talk to Abed.</p>
<p>I'm taking the file.</p>
<p>Oh, it says Abed is in the recovery parlor.</p>
<p>Condition never better.</p>
<p>You're not holding anything.</p>
<p>This is the file.</p>
<p>Abed Nadir, psychiatric patient 1373, control freak with no empathy.</p>
<p>People bend over backwards to cater to him.</p>
<p>Signed, healthcare administrator Annie Edison.</p>
<p>That's out of context.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>You've thought of everything, Annie.</p>
<p>With Abed gone and Troy and Britta together, there's nothing standing in the way of us.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Come on.</p>
<p>This is you dream.</p>
<p>This is why you played matchmaker.</p>
<p>This is what's important to you.</p>
<p>You are not Jeff.</p>
<p>Because Jeff cares about Abed.</p>
<p>And I did not push Troy and Britta together so this would happen.</p>
<p>I did it because I thought they were cute together and this would have been a bonus.</p>
<p>And we are not here.</p>
<p>And I'm not staying here because I hate whoever you are.</p>
<p>You should probably storm off in -- oh! In place.</p>
<p>Where do you wanna go next? I wanna be alone.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me.</p>
<p>Execute simulation, Annie/Annie.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Now we're alone.</p>
<p>Great, so you're me now.</p>
<p>Why are you blowing our magic moment with Jeff? It's not magic.</p>
<p>It's not even real.</p>
<p>But we love Jeff.</p>
<p>No, we don't.</p>
<p>We're just in love with the idea of being loved.</p>
<p>And if we can teach a guy like Jeff to do it, we'll never be unloved.</p>
<p>So we keep running the same scenario over and over hoping for a different result.</p>
<p>Running scenarios.</p>
<p>Careful now.</p>
<p>You're starting to sound like Abed.</p>
<p>So I probably shouldn't say things like "Star Wars. Zardoz, Cougar Town, cool, cool, cool." </p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Pop culture, pop culture.</p>
<p>I'm on a TV show.</p>
<p>You're gonna get in trouble.</p>
<p>Meta, meta.</p>
<p>It's Abed! I got an Abed here! Get him! That's it.</p>
<p>I find you guilty of being Abed.</p>
<p>You're under arrest! Can I just interject and say I don't know what the hell's going on? This time you'll never get out.</p>
<p>Abed? Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I found you by turning into you, how cool is that? Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Tell me where we are so I can pretend to see it.</p>
<p>We're inside a locker.</p>
<p>It's where I spent a lot of time in junior high.</p>
<p>You think this is where we'd put you? - You know that's absurd, right? - Well, I'm not stupid.</p>
<p>You can see I've increased the square footage.</p>
<p>It's a metaphorical locker.</p>
<p>It's a place where people like me get put when everyone's finally fed up with us.</p>
<p>Abed, so maudlin.</p>
<p>If you start turning into a vampire I've run the simulations, Annie.</p>
<p>I don't get married, I don't invent a billion dollar website that helps people have sex.</p>
<p>I don't make in into Sundance, Slamdance or Dance Pants.</p>
<p>Troy invents Dance Pants in 2019.</p>
<p>Don't tell him, he needs to stumble onto it.</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>The scenarios you run in here are like great science fiction.</p>
<p>They're impressive and detailed and insightful, but they're not accurate for crap.</p>
<p>Science fiction never has been.</p>
<p>Look at 2001.</p>
<p>Did we have a Space Odyssey? No, we got snowboarding in the Olympics and we over-validated <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Carson Daly</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004856'>Carson Daly</a></span><span class='years'>1973&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>music_department</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261983'>tt0261983</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839337'>tt1839337</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236348'>tt0236348</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167735'>tt0167735</a></span></span></span></span><span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Die Hard</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016'>Die Hard</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1988&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>as bad.</p>

<p>How is he? - He'll be okay.</p>
<p>It's so sweet how much you care about him.</p>
<p>And another thing I hate about Die Hard, two FB<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Die Hard</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016'>Die Hard</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1988&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span> named Johnson.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about our Inspector Spacetime scenario.</p>
<p>It might work better if instead of playing Geneva, you played Rosamund.</p>
<p>She was a constable in season five and she only had three lines.</p>
<p>I have a better idea.</p>
<p>You know what would make your scenarios a lot more realistic? If Troy weren't on a date.</p>
<p>Why don't you take all your thoughts and your logic and add one step to the process.</p>
<p>What are you doing? - From now on, before you do or say anything, you're gonna think about how it affects the people around you.</p>
<p>We lower functioning brains call this "empathy".</p>
<p>Abed? Abed? Oh, my God, I broke Abed.</p>
<p>Abed? You know how you wanted me to tell you when you were being scary weird instead of cute weird? This is scary weird.</p>
<p>Hello, Annie.</p>
<p>What was I doing on the floor? Were we doing it? Are you being Jeff? Well, I'm not being a Kardashian.</p>
<p>So where are we now? We're in the doctor's lounge of Greendale Hospital School.</p>
<p>Hospital school? It's a sexy emotional school where doctors save lives and make love, often simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our stories, ripped from the headlines.</p>
<p>Our passions, unbridled.</p>
<p>Our cafeteria, eh...</p>
<p>Make love to me, Ann.</p>
<p>I know I'm just a surgeon and you're a hotshot upstart administrator, but damn the rules, damn the system, damn our two foot height disparity, I want you.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed, I get it, we have different sensibilities.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Okay, Dr. Jeff, can you please tell me where I can find Abed? I owe him an apology.</p>
<p>Abed? Never heard of him.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>I asked you a question, doctor.</p>
<p>I'm a surgeon! And I'm your administrator! I left my wife for you and she was pregnant! Who do you think inseminated her? Now tell me what I want to know or God as my witness, I'll have your stethoscope.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry might know.</p>
<p>Render environment bio lab.</p>
<p>Look, there's Britta and Troy fooling around with each other.</p>
<p>Look, there's Abed having overcome his issues.</p>
<p>Nice try.</p>
<p>Dr. Barnes, Dr. Perry.</p>
<p>We just saved an uninsured homeless man's life.</p>
<p>Using an unapproved procedure.</p>
<p>Now, we're going to kiss.</p>
<p>This is what you think I want? What do you want, administrator? I want to talk to Abed.</p>
<p>There's no one here by that name.</p>
<p>You're lying.</p>
<p>Maybe I am, so what? I was raised on the mean streets of Harlem.</p>
<p>I'm not scared of you.</p>
<p>Well, be scared of this.</p>
<p>Sodium pentothal, known commonly as truth serum.</p>
<p>I saw Abed's name in the hospital school files, I love butt stuff, I hate spiders, I stole a pen from the bank, I cried during About a Boy, the soundtrack, I don't wash my hands before surgery.</p>
<p>I can see why women find Clive Owen attractive to the point where I might just as well be attracted to him.</p>
<p>I use comparisons to Hitler to win arguments on the Internet at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>I know nothing about wine.</p>
<p>I'm more turned on by women in pajamas than lingerie.</p>
<p>I just want to know they feel comfortable.</p>
<p>I didn't get Inception.</p>
<p>I didn't get Inception.</p>
<p>You said you saw his name in the files.</p>
<p>There's so many layers.</p>
<p>Right, render environment medical study room.</p>
<p>There's head nurse, Shirley, talking to tragic, heart-wrenching Alzheimer's patient and Emmy-contender, Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawthorne, you're out of your bed again.</p>
<p>'Cause I think I'm on a train.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Shirley, get me the file on Abed.</p>
<p>Abed doesn't exist, young lady.</p>
<p>He exists if I say so.</p>
<p>This is my hospital school.</p>
<p>Your hospital school, young lady, is a simulation being run through a filter of other people's needs.</p>
<p>Abed's been filtered out because nobody needs him.</p>
<p>I need him.</p>
<p>Well you're not simulated.</p>
<p>No, but this is! Ooh! And there's more where that didn't come from.</p>
<p>This is a private compartment.</p>
<p>Jeff, get the files.</p>
<p>Why me? Because you can see the cabinets.</p>
<p>And I'll make love to you.</p>
<p>Jackpot.</p>
<p>There is an Abed in this hospital school, but he's not a doctor.</p>
<p>He's a patient.</p>
<p>Notify security! - Conductor! Jeff, take me to Abed.</p>
<p>Where is that? Enough games, just take me where I wanna go.</p>
<p>Follow me.</p>
<p>Are we close? Almost there, although you should probably run in place and let the hall move around you.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>Where? Where you wanted to go.</p>
<p>The last night of school, first year.</p>
<p>The night we kissed.</p>
<p>Abed wasn't there, so whose memory is this? Maybe it's yours.</p>
<p>Maybe the Dreamatorium really works.</p>
<p>Or maybe Leonard was watching from the bushes and told Abed about it.</p>
<p>I don't have cable.</p>
<p>Knock it off, Abed.</p>
<p>I'm not Abed.</p>
<p>You're confused, so was I.</p>
<p>But not anymore.</p>
<p>Jeff, Abed, stop! I don't wanna do this.</p>
<p>I want to talk to Abed.</p>
<p>I'm taking the file.</p>
<p>Oh, it says Abed is in the recovery parlor.</p>
<p>Condition never better.</p>
<p>You're not holding anything.</p>
<p>This is the file.</p>
<p>Abed Nadir, psychiatric patient 1373, control freak with no empathy.</p>
<p>People bend over backwards to cater to him.</p>
<p>Signed, healthcare administrator Annie Edison.</p>
<p>That's out of context.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>You've thought of everything, Annie.</p>
<p>With Abed gone and Troy and Britta together, there's nothing standing in the way of us.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Come on.</p>
<p>This is you dream.</p>
<p>This is why you played matchmaker.</p>
<p>This is what's important to you.</p>
<p>You are not Jeff.</p>
<p>Because Jeff cares about Abed.</p>
<p>And I did not push Troy and Britta together so this would happen.</p>
<p>I did it because I thought they were cute together and this would have been a bonus.</p>
<p>And we are not here.</p>
<p>And I'm not staying here because I hate whoever you are.</p>
<p>You should probably storm off in -- oh! In place.</p>
<p>Where do you wanna go next? I wanna be alone.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me.</p>
<p>Execute simulation, Annie/Annie.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Now we're alone.</p>
<p>Great, so you're me now.</p>
<p>Why are you blowing our magic moment with Jeff? It's not magic.</p>
<p>It's not even real.</p>
<p>But we love Jeff.</p>
<p>No, we don't.</p>
<p>We're just in love with the idea of being loved.</p>
<p>And if we can teach a guy like Jeff to do it, we'll never be unloved.</p>
<p>So we keep running the same scenario over and over hoping for a different result.</p>
<p>Running scenarios.</p>
<p>Careful now.</p>
<p>You're starting to sound like Abed.</p>
<p>So I probably shouldn't say things like "Star Wars. Zardoz, Cougar Town, cool, cool,<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Zardoz</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070948'>Zardoz</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1974&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span><span class='tag genre'>Fantasy</span><span class='tag genre'>Sci-Fi</span></span></span></span>" </p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Pop culture, pop culture.</p>
<p>I'm on a TV show.</p>
<p>You're gonna get in trouble.</p>
<p>Meta, meta.</p>
<p>It's Abed! I got an Abed here! Get him! That's it.</p>
<p>I find you guilty of being Abed.</p>
<p>You're under arrest! Can I just interject and say I don't know what the hell's going on? This time you'll never get out.</p>
<p>Abed? Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I found you by turning into you, how cool is that? Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Tell me where we are so I can pretend to see it.</p>
<p>We're inside a locker.</p>
<p>It's where I spent a lot of time in junior high.</p>
<p>You think this is where we'd put you? - You know that's absurd, right? - Well, I'm not stupid.</p>
<p>You can see I've increased the square footage.</p>
<p>It's a metaphorical locker.</p>
<p>It's a place where people like me get put when everyone's finally fed up with us.</p>
<p>Abed, so maudlin.</p>
<p>If you start turning into a vampire I've run the simulations, Annie.</p>
<p>I don't get married, I don't invent a billion dollar website that helps people have sex.</p>
<p>I don't make in into Sundance, Slamdance or Dance Pants.</p>
<p>Troy invents Dance Pants in 2019.</p>
<p>Don't tell him, he needs to stumble onto it.</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>The scenarios you run in here are like great science fiction.</p>
<p>They're impressive and detailed and insightful, but they're not accurate for crap.</p>
<p>Science fiction never has been.</p>
<p>Look at 2001.</p>
<p>Did we have a Space Odyssey? No, we got snowboarding in the Olympics and we over-validated Carson Daly.</p>
<p>That poor guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, cry me a river.</p>
<p>My point is, your simulations are nothing more than anxieties.</p>
<p>You're afraid you don't fit in.</p>
<p>You're afraid you'll be alone.</p>
<p>Great news you share that with all of us, so you'll never be alone and you'll always fit in.</p>
<p>And, yes, that's why I meddled with Troy and Britta.</p>
<p>You caught me.</p>
<p>I was trying to make life go according to some script.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>You can't.</p>
<p>We both need to get more comfortable winging it.</p>
<p>At least it'll be less work.</p>
<p>It would cut down my Dreamatorium time by 18 hours a week.</p>
<p>I could take up yoga.</p>
<p>You've got the body type.</p>
<p>Now let's get you out of here.</p>
<p>I don't know how.</p>
<p>These fake shackles don't have a fake key.</p>
<p>Isn't that what a quantum spanner's for? Technically, no.</p>
<p>But that's fine.</p>
<p>So should we get back to lunch? I guess so.</p>
<p>A little more anticlimactic than I would have simulated it, - but whatever.</p>
<p>Anticlimactic? Render environment observo-deck, H.M.S. Spacetime 12.</p>
<p>Inspector, set the tachyon drive to hyperjump.</p>
<p>We must get to the other side of this star field before the Blorgons intercept.</p>
<p>Blorgons in this sector? Well, this mission has gone pear-shaped, indeed.</p>
<p>Prepare to hyperjump on my mark.</p>
<p>Bugger the dovecoats, inspector.</p>
<p>We're too late! Blorgons! Eradicate! Eradicate! Our quantum blasters are useless against their armor.</p>
<p>We're as cooked as Lord Nelson's mutton, we are.</p>
<p>Not if I can help it.</p>
<p>I'll see you on the other side, Inspector, wherever that is.</p>
<p>Don't you mean "whenever that is"? Take that, Blorgon scum! You'll blo-gon me for this later.</p>
<p>Ow, Annie! Oh, oh, my God! Abed, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>No, no, you're committing.</p>
<p>This is good stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I am Abed Nadir, and I don't know a lot of things everyone else knows.</p>
<p>I wander the universe with my friend, Troy, doing whatever I want.</p>
<p>Sometimes accidentally hurting innocent unremarkables.</p>
<p>This week, however, Troy went to lunch and I adapted.</p>
<p>I now have the ability to enter the minds of others.</p>
<p>I'm hungry, are you hungry? - Yeah.</p>
<p>I'll make us buttered noodles.</p>
<p>Using an elusive new technique known as "empathy".</p>
<p>So was the other fast food place worth the drive, Shirley? You know, halfway there I thought, "What am I doing? It's the same fast food place in a different location. Have the margins of my life become so narrow?" So I went to the mall and had pizza.</p>
<p>Sounds like this has been a game-changing day for all of us.</p>
<p>I almost sat on my balls, but at the last second, I made an adjustment.</p>
<p>Good job! </p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>Good job, man.</p>
<p>Well, we had a good lunch, too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I spoke to the manager about Die Hard, an<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Die Hard</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016'>Die Hard</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1988&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span> him he should be ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Sorry I bailed on the Dreamatorium.</p>
<p>It's okay, Annie did pretty good in a pinch.</p>
<p>All right, back to cramming? The people at the bank loved my outfit.</p>
<p>And they had all kinds of questions about it and my answers seemed to amuse and and even liberate them a little.</p>
<p>A few of us went to lunch and I had the deepest conversation of my life.</p>
<p>I gotta go, I'm telling everybody.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe after a long, dark night, the sun is starting to rise on Greendale.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>You never can tell what kind of day you're gonna have.</p>
<p>Okay, I didn't really avoid sitting on them.</p>
<p>I sat right on them.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Pierce, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Hurt like hell.</p>
<p>I saw eagles.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed in the morning!</p>
<p>Today we're joined by Annie Edison --</p>
<p>Hi! </p>
<p>Who's gonna show us how to spruce up your apartment on a budget.</p>
<p>So, Annie, what inspired this throw? Well, I just thought that I'd cover up the stain where Abed spilled code red on the couch last week.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Crafty.</p>
<p>And you have some tips on entertaining.</p>
<p>Yes, if you're expecting company, but you don't have enough chairs, you can bring out pillows from your bedroom and use them on the floor for a Moroccan feel.</p>
<p>Ooh, a taste of the Orient.</p>
<p>Ooh! Actually, boys, I have a little surprise for you.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>While you two were out playing blazer tag -</p>
<p>That's laser tag with sport coats.</p>
<p>I did a little extreme bedroom makeover! I unbunked your beds and got scrap fabric and -</p>
<p>It's okay, buddy.</p>
<p>We can put it back.</p>
<p>We can put it back the way it was.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>It's cut, Garrett.</p>
<p>Sorry!</p>
