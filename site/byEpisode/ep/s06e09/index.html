<p>You haven't looked at the new courses.</p>
<p>I'm like a kid in a candy store.</p>
<p>Candy lost its appeal now that I work at the store.</p>
<p>Becoming a teacher here gave me diabetes.</p>
<p>I was just saying that.</p>
<p>Are you always thirsty, fatigued and have blurry vision and your cuts heal slower? - Those are actual diabetes symptoms.</p>
<p>That's what the doctor said.</p>
<p>So is he treating it? - I asked him the same thing.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>"Make an appointment through his office during business hours. This is his home. His children sleep here." </p>
<p>You know doctors.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, you guys.</p>
<p>There's a class called Basic Grifting.</p>
<p>Should we all learn how to be grifters together? - Wait, what do grifters do again? - I got this.</p>
<p>I'll tell you for 5 bucks.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You better sign me up.</p>
<p>I've wanted to learn grifting since I saw The Grifters featuring <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>John Cusack</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131'>John Cusack</a></span><span class='years'>1966&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>writer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258'>tt0098258</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229'>tt0119229</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385'>tt0450385</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882'>tt0146882</a></span></span></span></span>, <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Anjelica Huston</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001378'>Anjelica Huston</a></span><span class='years'>1951&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>director</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106220'>tt0106220</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100944'>tt0100944</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120631'>tt0120631</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101272'>tt0101272</a></span></span></span></span> and almost no grifting.</p>
<p>Don't take a grifting class.</p>
<p>You're gonna get grifted.</p>
<p>More so than by that oceanography class.</p>
<p>Only none of you will get a goldfish.</p>
<p>Then you'll come back to me.</p>
<p>Why you? Let's face it, I'm the closest thing that Greendale has to an experienced grifter.</p>
<p>Oh, this is one of those things where Jeff gets jealous of something dumb.</p>
<p>Jeff's jealous of a grifter.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Because he wishes he was still a grifter.</p>
<p>That's something I can mock, and I live in an RV.</p>
<p>My table folds down from the wall.</p>
<p>I say we take the grifting class together have a great time and rub it in Jeff's face.</p>
<p>Who's in and can you cover me? I'll pay you back.</p>
<p>I'll get it from your parents.</p>
<p>I'll pay you back.</p>
<p>And I'll pay back your parents.</p>
<p>Which will be never.</p>
<p>I'll get a high-five from your parents.</p>
<p>Each student should bring a briefcase.</p>
<p>I don't have a briefcase.</p>
<p>We're gonna grift with briefcases? Basic, my ass.</p>
<p>That's advanced.</p>
<p>I have a few extra briefcases.</p>
<p>Shocker.</p>
<p>We each need a regulation grifting briefcase.</p>
<p>It's a grift.</p>
<p>What's a regulation briefcase? I don't know, but they're provided for only $150.</p>
<p>You're being grifted.</p>
<p>Shut up, Jeff.</p>
<p>You're such a negative person.</p>
<p>What do you contribute to this group besides negativity? Guys, watch this.</p>
<p>Can I borrow $150? - No.</p>
<p>See? Now, who's gonna come with me and show this guy what's up? - I'll pay you back.</p>
<p>I'll get it from your parents.</p>
<p>Tell them I spit on their wealth, and thank you.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>My name is Professor Roger DeSalvo, for the time being.</p>
<p>For I use many a pseudonym.</p>
<p>Such as Jeff Goulash, Phillip Switch or Baz Ravish.</p>
<p>For I am a grifter and this is Grifting 101.</p>
<p>Now, which one of you thinks I did that on purpose? Exactly, you think you've seen me fail.</p>
<p>You think you've spotted a weakness.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>With the flick of a wrist I could show you a fool one minute or longer.</p>
<p>I see you've got your briefcases.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Hold them aloft.</p>
<p>Pass them to each other.</p>
<p>Now pass them back.</p>
<p>Do it at speed.</p>
<p>Quicker.</p>
<p>Pass them like hell.</p>
<p>Pass them like your sister's dying.</p>
<p>And continue that for about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Forty minutes? - What's your name, my love? - Annie Edison.</p>
<p>Sounds like a real name, not the name of a grifter and therefore, not a teacher.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>What? My name is Slick Pockets Tucker.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>What will the next lesson be? The next lesson will be passing two briefcases.</p>
<p>You need to master the art of passing one then you can purchase another briefcase.</p>
<p>What? - You talk too much.</p>
<p>Keep passing.</p>
<p>It's a very funny book.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Grifters.</p>
<p>I better watch my french fries, unless Counterfeit? Where'd you learn to do that? - We didn't learn anything.</p>
<p>The class is - A rip-off? What's another word for that? - All he did was make us pass briefcases.</p>
<p>He kept trying to sell us stuff.</p>
<p>Briefcase-swapping talcum for grifter's palm.</p>
<p>Oil for silent switcheroos.</p>
<p>Something called extra believable socks.</p>
<p>Those are actually half off.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like I grifted him.</p>
<p>So, in a sense, what happened is you took a class about grifting and? Jeff, you really need us to say it? - You were - Whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I need you to say it.</p>
<p>Let me just get settled.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Okay, go.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>Oh, aah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you live and you learn, guys.</p>
<p>Well, you live, anyway.</p>
<p>So now will you please help us? - Help you? - We want revenge.</p>
<p>We wanna grift him back.</p>
<p>Grift a grifter? That's as dumb as taking his class.</p>
<p>Cut your losses.</p>
<p>Jeff, I begged you not to go down this path, and you made fun of me.</p>
<p>You pointed at my face and laughed.</p>
<p>We're sorry.</p>
<p>My feelings are fine.</p>
<p>I'm just very lazy, and you gave me an excuse to do nothing.</p>
<p>I'm not just gonna throw that away.</p>
<p>He's even lazier than you.</p>
<p>Doesn't your species consider that a challenge? Shouldn't you be having some reverse pissing contest to determine who's laziest? Wait, is that where you suck it back up in your? Sorry.</p>
<p>I've only ever done it the other way.</p>
<p>You mean peeing? No, I mean in the back.</p>
<p>He hasn't done anything to me.</p>
<p>In fact, he sounds like a pretty good guy.</p>
<p>I bet we'd get along.</p>
<p>Good show.</p>
<p>Good show.</p>
<p>What show? I haven't seen that show.</p>
<p>All right, all the best.</p>
<p>And you are? Well, I was the guy with a full bottle of Scotch and a high tolerance for foreigners.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>How robust.</p>
<p>I imagine that you're Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Turns out we're going to be office buddies.</p>
<p>Hello there, sir.</p>
<p>My name is Roger DeSalvo.</p>
<p>Or is it? You see, I happen to be in the Grifting 101.</p>
<p>Yes, I've heard about you.</p>
<p>That would be your desk.</p>
<p>If you need a mnemonic device it's the one without someone's stuff all over it.</p>
<p>Well played.</p>
<p>Very well played.</p>
<p>I gotta say I admire your style.</p>
<p>Grifting people by selling them grifting lessons? It's genius.</p>
<p>But I call - I never said my class was a grift.</p>
<p>Don't worry about me.</p>
<p>I'm one of you.</p>
<p>Was, anyway.</p>
<p>Do tell.</p>
<p>Well, I worked in one of the top law firms in the city as a lawyer.</p>
<p>But guess what.</p>
<p>I'm not a lawyer.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>No, I think you're talking about lying.</p>
<p>Grifting happens to be an art form.</p>
<p>The art of lying.</p>
<p>Let's not get high-handed.</p>
<p>Grifting is lying.</p>
<p>Okay, so like a string is a sweater.</p>
<p>Like paint is the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>Sure, grifting includes lying, but only a liar would call grifting lying.</p>
<p>And only a delusional hobo would glorify stealing.</p>
<p>Did you say something that wasn't true? - Maybe we should phone the museum.</p>
<p>I was on your side.</p>
<p>You're an ass.</p>
<p>Well, you're a craftless, artless thug.</p>
<p>And I'm God's paintbrush.</p>
<p>No, I am God.</p>
<p>Which pretty much makes me better than you.</p>
<p>You know what? Let's agree to disagree.</p>
<p>It's not important.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so you can lie.</p>
<p>Yeah? You liar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna speak to you, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>What? I love you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Why are you guys still doing that? Well, it was homework.</p>
<p>And we're getting better, right? Or the friction has melted the handle to fit into our palms.</p>
<p>There's nothing to get better at.</p>
<p>The class is a grift.</p>
<p>The next person that says "grift" is gonna grift.</p>
<p>My God, now it's replacing other words.</p>
<p>All right, I'm in.</p>
<p>Let's grift the son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Why are you cheering? He could be saying anything.</p>
<p>Grift, grift, grift.</p>
<p>Grift, grift, grift.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>I can't remember your name.</p>
<p>Likewise, no idea what your name is.</p>
<p>Great job.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'd say you're pretty close to swapping with briefcases Ioaded with actual fake money, such as this.</p>
<p>This isn't real money.</p>
<p>It's just cut-up newspaper, but it weighs the same.</p>
<p>Costs $5 apiece.</p>
<p>You'll be using 10.</p>
<p>Telegram for Elroy Patashnik.</p>
<p>I'm Patashnik.</p>
<p>Telegram, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>My Aunt Baba died on vacation while in Africa.</p>
<p>She left me a million dollars.</p>
<p>The African government wants to seize the funds.</p>
<p>Class dismissed.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>Are you out of your mind? - What? - The African Telegram.</p>

<p>Are you trying to grift me? - I'll cut you in for 14 grand.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Out.</p>
<p>One more thing.</p>
<p>Nice try twice.</p>
<p>Twice? The fake grift within the grift.</p>
<p>The double bean, if you like.</p>
<p>I'm gonna mention a name and however you react, I'll know the truth.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>That's the one.</p>
<p>What? Who? - Who? Jeff Winger? That's the one.</p>
<p>Out you go.</p>
<p>Say hi to him.</p>
<p>By the way, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Nice try thrice.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>How was grifting class? Did you teach advanced grifting techniques only you could understand? The Brown Betty? The Texas Well Baby? The Reverse Jim Gaffigan? Well, I wouldn't teach the African Telegram since I'm not a hack, and also since the Internet.</p>
<p>Okay, you caught me.</p>
<p>Game over.</p>
<p>Let's end this competition.</p>
<p>Cheers to that.</p>
<p>Uh, sir? You -- that guy left his lottery ticket on the table.</p>
<p>That was the telegram man.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't.</p>
<p>I mean, what telegram? - Exactly.</p>
<p>What telegram? Because the Internet.</p>
<p>You know, that place you obviously went to, to type in the word "grifting." </p>
<p>I'm gonna grift you.</p>
<p>I'm gonna grift your ass.</p>
<p>Or is that the grift? None of it's a grift.</p>
<p>It's all nonsense.</p>
<p>Okay, how many times have I told you people the faculty lounge is not a bar? All right, pack it up, people.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You don't have to go teach a class, but you can't stay here.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Truce.</p>
<p>Okay? Promise no more grifting and promise, if this is worth a million, we'll split it.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm a genius.</p>
<p>I can answer that.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Can an idiot walk backwards like this and not hit anything? - Maybe.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>What? What are you doing here? This guy is a grifter.</p>
<p>Professor of grifting.</p>
<p>He charges $400, you get two briefcases and your ex-boyfriend becomes an obsessive I didn't know you and Winger were lovers.</p>
<p>If he wanted my respect he should've opened with that.</p>
<p>Are you trying to be disarming? - Are you grifting me out of my arms? - I did nothing.</p>
<p>He called himself a grifter.</p>
<p>I corrected him.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the truth is so important to the both of you.</p>
<p>So, what's it gonna cost to make you go away? - Ahem.</p>
<p>Well? He took the bait.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I thought we didn't want him to take the bait.</p>
<p>We're saying the same thing.</p>
<p>He didn't take the bait we didn't want taken.</p>
<p>The African Telegram.</p>
<p>Yeah, which was offered as fake bait and taken as such, i.</p>
<p>e.</p>
<p>, not taken.</p>
<p>Because that made him feel in control.</p>
<p>And by avoiding all visible bait he placed himself on the hook of assuming we're planning to grift him.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we are.</p>
<p>So he knows the truth.</p>
<p>Isn't that the one thing you're not supposed to know when you're being grifted? Hmm.</p>
<p>He can know a plan all he wants.</p>
<p>But the plan he knows won't be our plan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because our plan is impossible to know? Because --</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Jeff is making this up as we go.</p>
<p>Shh! Just knock it off.</p>
<p>What do you want from me? - We wanted you to help us do a grift.</p>
<p>I'm working on it.</p>
<p>Improvisationally? - They had a plan in The Sting.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to watch it, it knocks out half a day.</p>
<p>Look, do you guys remember when we hugged and jumped up and down in the cafeteria? Obviously.</p>
<p>Having been together virtually nonstop ever since at what point do you think I slipped off and planned an entire grift then withheld it from you? At any of the several dozen points when a normal person would say: "By the way, I have no plan." </p>
<p>In The Sting, they withhold stuff from each other.</p>
<p>Or from the audience, for effect.</p>
<p>Also, - Why don't you marry The Sting? - Lf we have half-Sting children when they ask how to grift, I'll tell them to watch their mother.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>You are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Bad stinger.</p>
<p>Shut up, okay? You guys, you're You're always picking on me, all right? You've really been hammering me lately.</p>
<p>All I had was the idea that -- Look, I, I need this.</p>
<p>I need to be better than this guy.</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you bring your laptop? - Right here.</p>
<p>What do you wanna do with it? Watch The Sting.</p>
<p>It's over.</p>
<p>What happened? Who got shot? Ahem.</p>
<p>What's going on? Was Sting even in it? - That was terrible.</p>
<p>You slept the whole time.</p>
<p>The dialogue seeped in my dreams.</p>
<p>My whole brain is long and quiet.</p>
<p>So how did they grift him? Well, they basically made a fake building and hired a thousand people to cooperate in perfect secrecy.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Should we just do that? - We could watch another grifter movie.</p>
<p>More activity in Matchstick Men.</p>
<p>Like what? - At one point, they build a fake hospital.</p>
<p>So much construction.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>It's so late.</p>
<p>You're gonna bail on me, aren't you? - I think we have to, Jeff.</p>
<p>We've tried everything we can.</p>
<p>Maybe over the weekend, I can make a fake building.</p>
<p>But all the briefcases and the swapping and The Sting? I'm not cut out for it.</p>
<p>I think real grifts only happen in movies.</p>
<p>Even then, they barely make sense.</p>
<p>Look, I'm old.</p>
<p>The Sting is terrible.</p>
<p>Grifting is stupid.</p>
<p>The writing's on the wall.</p>
<p>So that's it.</p>
<p>There's no shame in this, Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know about that.</p>
<p>Well, this is a scene to behold.</p>
<p>Huddled in the closet, watching The Sting like gypsies.</p>
<p>Roger.</p>
<p>We surrender.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>I'm no grifter.</p>
<p>No, I was wrong.</p>
<p>If you remember, I called you a thug.</p>
<p>Thugs fight.</p>
<p>You're more --</p>
<p>No, I can't think of a metaphor pathetic enough to suit you, Jeff Winger.</p>

<p>I'll get a high-five from your parents.</p>
<p>Each student should bring a briefcase.</p>
<p>I don't have a briefcase.</p>
<p>We're gonna grift with briefcases? Basic, my ass.</p>
<p>That's advanced.</p>
<p>I have a few extra briefcases.</p>
<p>Shocker.</p>
<p>We each need a regulation grifting briefcase.</p>
<p>It's a grift.</p>
<p>What's a regulation briefcase? I don't know, but they're provided for only $150.</p>
<p>You're being grifted.</p>
<p>Shut up, Jeff.</p>
<p>You're such a negative person.</p>
<p>What do you contribute to this group besides negativity? Guys, watch this.</p>
<p>Can I borrow $150? - No.</p>
<p>See? Now, who's gonna come with me and show this guy what's up? - I'll pay you back.</p>
<p>I'll get it from your parents.</p>
<p>Tell them I spit on their wealth, and thank you.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>My name is Professor Roger DeSalvo, for the time being.</p>
<p>For I use many a pseudonym.</p>
<p>Such as Jeff Goulash, Phillip Switch or Baz Ravish.</p>
<p>For I am a grifter and this is Grifting 101.</p>
<p>Now, which one of you thinks I did that on purpose? Exactly, you think you've seen me fail.</p>
<p>You think you've spotted a weakness.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>With the flick of a wrist I could show you a fool one minute or longer.</p>
<p>I see you've got your briefcases.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Hold them aloft.</p>
<p>Pass them to each other.</p>
<p>Now pass them back.</p>
<p>Do it at speed.</p>
<p>Quicker.</p>
<p>Pass them like hell.</p>
<p>Pass them like your sister's dying.</p>
<p>And continue that for about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Forty minutes? - What's your name, my love? - Annie Edison.</p>
<p>Sounds like a real name, not the name of a grifter and therefore, not a teacher.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>What? My name is Slick Pockets Tucker.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>What will the next lesson be? The next lesson will be passing two briefcases.</p>
<p>You need to master the art of passing one then you can purchase another briefcase.</p>
<p>What? - You talk too much.</p>
<p>Keep passing.</p>
<p>It's a very funny book.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Grifters.</p>
<p>I better watch my french fries, unless Counterfeit? Where'd you learn to do that? - We didn't learn anything.</p>
<p>The class is - A rip-off? What's another word for that? - All he did was make us pass briefcases.</p>
<p>He kept trying to sell us stuff.</p>
<p>Briefcase-swapping talcum for grifter's palm.</p>
<p>Oil for silent switcheroos.</p>
<p>Something called extra believable socks.</p>
<p>Those are actually half off.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like I grifted him.</p>
<p>So, in a sense, what happened is you took a class about grifting and? Jeff, you really need us to say it? - You were - Whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I need you to say it.</p>
<p>Let me just get settled.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Okay, go.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>Oh, aah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you live and you learn, guys.</p>
<p>Well, you live, anyway.</p>
<p>So now will you please help us? - Help you? - We want revenge.</p>
<p>We wanna grift him back.</p>
<p>Grift a grifter? That's as dumb as taking his class.</p>
<p>Cut your losses.</p>
<p>Jeff, I begged you not to go down this path, and you made fun of me.</p>
<p>You pointed at my face and laughed.</p>
<p>We're sorry.</p>
<p>My feelings are fine.</p>
<p>I'm just very lazy, and you gave me an excuse to do nothing.</p>
<p>I'm not just gonna throw that away.</p>
<p>He's even lazier than you.</p>
<p>Doesn't your species consider that a challenge? Shouldn't you be having some reverse pissing contest to determine who's laziest? Wait, is that where you suck it back up in your? Sorry.</p>
<p>I've only ever done it the other way.</p>
<p>You mean peeing? No, I mean in the back.</p>
<p>He hasn't done anything to me.</p>
<p>In fact, he sounds like a pretty good guy.</p>
<p>I bet we'd get along.</p>
<p>Good show.</p>
<p>Good show.</p>
<p>What show? I haven't seen that show.</p>
<p>All right, all the best.</p>
<p>And you are? Well, I was the guy with a full bottle of Scotch and a high tolerance for foreigners.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>How robust.</p>
<p>I imagine that you're Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Turns out we're going to be office buddies.</p>
<p>Hello there, sir.</p>
<p>My name is Roger DeSalvo.</p>
<p>Or is it? You see, I happen to be in the Grifting 101.</p>
<p>Yes, I've heard about you.</p>
<p>That would be your desk.</p>
<p>If you need a mnemonic device it's the one without someone's stuff all over it.</p>
<p>Well played.</p>
<p>Very well played.</p>
<p>I gotta say I admire your style.</p>
<p>Grifting people by selling them grifting lessons? It's genius.</p>
<p>But I call - I never said my class was a grift.</p>
<p>Don't worry about me.</p>
<p>I'm one of you.</p>
<p>Was, anyway.</p>
<p>Do tell.</p>
<p>Well, I worked in one of the top law firms in the city as a lawyer.</p>
<p>But guess what.</p>
<p>I'm not a lawyer.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>No, I think you're talking about lying.</p>
<p>Grifting happens to be an art form.</p>
<p>The art of lying.</p>
<p>Let's not get high-handed.</p>
<p>Grifting is lying.</p>
<p>Okay, so like a string is a sweater.</p>
<p>Like paint is the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>Sure, grifting includes lying, but only a liar would call grifting lying.</p>
<p>And only a delusional hobo would glorify stealing.</p>
<p>Did you say something that wasn't true? - Maybe we should phone the museum.</p>
<p>I was on your side.</p>
<p>You're an ass.</p>
<p>Well, you're a craftless, artless thug.</p>
<p>And I'm God's paintbrush.</p>
<p>No, I am God.</p>
<p>Which pretty much makes me better than you.</p>
<p>You know what? Let's agree to disagree.</p>
<p>It's not important.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so you can lie.</p>
<p>Yeah? You liar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna speak to you, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>What? I love you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Why are you guys still doing that? Well, it was homework.</p>
<p>And we're getting better, right? Or the friction has melted the handle to fit into our palms.</p>
<p>There's nothing to get better at.</p>
<p>The class is a grift.</p>
<p>The next person that says "grift" is gonna grift.</p>
<p>My God, now it's replacing other words.</p>
<p>All right, I'm in.</p>
<p>Let's grift the son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Why are you cheering? He could be saying anything.</p>
<p>Grift, grift, grift.</p>
<p>Grift, grift, grift.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>I can't remember your name.</p>
<p>Likewise, no idea what your name is.</p>
<p>Great job.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'd say you're pretty close to swapping with briefcases Ioaded with actual fake money, such as this.</p>
<p>This isn't real money.</p>
<p>It's just cut-up newspaper, but it weighs the same.</p>
<p>Costs $5 apiece.</p>
<p>You'll be using 10.</p>
<p>Telegram for Elroy Patashnik.</p>
<p>I'm Patashnik.</p>
<p>Telegram, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>My Aunt Baba died on vacation while in Africa.</p>
<p>She left me a million dollars.</p>
<p>The African government wants to seize the funds.</p>
<p>Class dismissed.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>Are you out of your mind? - What? - The African Telegram.</p>
<p>The Jim Belushi of grifts.</p>
<p>Are you trying to grift me? - I'll cut you in for 14 grand.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Out.</p>
<p>One more thing.</p>
<p>Nice try twice.</p>
<p>Twice? The fake grift within the grift.</p>
<p>The double bean, if you like.</p>
<p>I'm gonna mention a name and however you react, I'll know the truth.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>That's the one.</p>
<p>What? Who? - Who? Jeff Winger? That's the one.</p>
<p>Out you go.</p>
<p>Say hi to him.</p>
<p>By the way, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Nice try thrice.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>How was grifting class? Did you teach advanced grifting techniques only you could understand? The Brown Betty? The Texas Well Baby? The Reverse Jim Gaffigan? Well, I wouldn't teach the African Telegram since I'm not a hack, and also since the Internet.</p>
<p>Okay, you caught me.</p>
<p>Game over.</p>
<p>Let's end this competition.</p>
<p>Cheers to that.</p>
<p>Uh, sir? You -- that guy left his lottery ticket on the table.</p>
<p>That was the telegram man.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't.</p>
<p>I mean, what telegram? - Exactly.</p>
<p>What telegram? Because the Internet.</p>
<p>You know, that place you obviously went to, to type in the word "grifting." </p>
<p>I'm gonna grift you.</p>
<p>I'm gonna grift your ass.</p>
<p>Or is that the grift? None of it's a grift.</p>
<p>It's all nonsense.</p>
<p>Okay, how many times have I told you people the faculty lounge is not a bar? All right, pack it up, people.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You don't have to go teach a class, but you can't stay here.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Truce.</p>
<p>Okay? Promise no more grifting and promise, if this is worth a million, we'll split it.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm a genius.</p>
<p>I can answer that.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Can an idiot walk backwards like this and not hit anything? - Maybe.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>What? What are you doing here? This guy is a grifter.</p>
<p>Professor of grifting.</p>
<p>He charges $400, you get two briefcases and your ex-boyfriend becomes an obsessive I didn't know you and Winger were lovers.</p>
<p>If he wanted my respect he should've opened with that.</p>
<p>Are you trying to be disarming? - Are you grifting me out of my arms? - I did nothing.</p>
<p>He called himself a grifter.</p>
<p>I corrected him.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the truth is so important to the both of you.</p>
<p>So, what's it gonna cost to make you go away? - Ahem.</p>
<p>Well? He took the bait.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I thought we didn't want him to take the bait.</p>
<p>We're saying the same thing.</p>
<p>He didn't take the bait we didn't want taken.</p>
<p>The African Telegram.</p>
<p>Yeah, which was offered as fake bait and taken as such, i.</p>
<p>e.</p>
<p>, not taken.</p>
<p>Because that made him feel in control.</p>
<p>And by avoiding all visible bait he placed himself on the hook of assuming we're planning to grift him.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we are.</p>
<p>So he knows the truth.</p>
<p>Isn't that the one thing you're not supposed to know when you're being grifted? Hmm.</p>
<p>He can know a plan all he wants.</p>
<p>But the plan he knows won't be our plan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because our plan is impossible to know? Because --</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Jeff is making this up as we go.</p>
<p>Shh! Just knock it off.</p>
<p>What do you want from me? - We wanted you to help us do a grift.</p>
<p>I'm working on it.</p>
<p>Improvisationally? - They had a plan in The Sting.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to watch it, it knocks <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>The Sting</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105854'>The Sting</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1992&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span>a day.</p>
<p>Look, do you guys remember when we hugged and jumped up and down in the cafeteria? Obviously.</p>
<p>Having been together virtually nonstop ever since at what point do you think I slipped off and planned an entire grift then withheld it from you? At any of the several dozen points when a normal person would say: "By the way, I have no plan." </p>
<p>In The Sting, they withhold stuff from each other.</p>

<p>Not you.</p>
<p>You are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Bad stinger.</p>
<p>Shut up, okay? You guys, you're You're always picking on me, all right? You've really been hammering me lately.</p>
<p>All I had was the idea that -- Look, I, I need this.</p>
<p>I need to be better than this guy.</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you bring your laptop? - Right here.</p>
<p>What do you wanna do with it? Watch The Sting.</p>

Was Sting even in it? - That was terrible.</p>
<p>You slept the whole time.</p>
<p>The dialogue seeped in my dreams.</p>
<p>My whole brain is long and quiet.</p>
<p>So how did they grift him? Well, they basically made a fake building and hired a thousand people to cooperate in perfect secrecy.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Should we just do that? - We could watch another grifter movie.</p>
<p>More activity in Matchstick Men.</p>
<p>Like what? - At one point, they build a fake hospital.<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Matchstick Men</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325805'>Matchstick Men</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>2003&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span></span></span></span>ruction.</p>

<p>You're gonna bail on me, aren't you? - I think we have to, Jeff.</p>
<p>We've tried everything we can.</p>
<p>Maybe over the weekend, I can make a fake building.</p>
<p>But all the briefcases and the swapping and The Sting? I'm not cut out for it.</p>

<p>If you remember, I called you a thug.</p>
<p>Thugs fight.</p>
<p>You're more --</p>
<p>No, I can't think of a metaphor pathetic enough to suit you, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>I'm reminded of something Oscar Wilde once said when he compared sheep to wolves.</p>
<p>Screw it.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>You hit me.</p>
<p>With a woman's hand.</p>
<p>You Midwestern floozy.</p>
<p>I lived in New York.</p>
<p>Aah! Yeah, right, he's grifting us.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Grift blood.</p>
<p>Someone taste it.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's karo syrup and food dye.</p>
<p>I mean, I would, but my diabetes.</p>
<p>19, 20, 21.</p>
<p>Are you counting the amount of money or the number of stacks? Um - I have to start over.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>Move.</p>
<p>But I want to go on record as being disgusted by this transaction.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Disgusted.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, love, but would you rather we took this to court? No, no, no.</p>
<p>We appreciate you keeping this between us.</p>
<p>I wanna remind you we offer a lot of classes and many of them are cash-only.</p>
<p>Me, take a class here? Talk about a rip-off.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>Talk about a ribbing.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>What the hell am I doing? You know, so far, Frankie's disgusted and that's it.</p>
<p>Seems like a waste of a record.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, guys.</p>
<p>This is all my fault.</p>
<p>Don't be.</p>
<p>I'm the one who got into a pissing match.</p>
<p>With a jerk.</p>
<p>You're a jerk.</p>
<p>You're a jerk.</p>
<p>You're a jerk.</p>
<p>You're all jerks.</p>
<p>And this whole school can suck a big one.</p>
<p>And you can put that in your record.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, guys.</p>
<p>I'm bound by my station.</p>
<p>Speaking on that topic.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>This is all your fault and you're expelled.</p>
<p>No, dean - Let Let me handle this.</p>
<p>Pelton, you can't do that.</p>
<p>Britta's the heart of this group.</p>
<p>She started it.</p>
<p>As a As a fake biology group so that she could have sex with Troy.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That's exactly it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don't let me handle it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You can't expel Britta.</p>
<p>She's been here six years.</p>
<p>Three more and she'll have her two-year degree.</p>
<p>Britta keeps me grounded in reality.</p>
<p>You can't expel her with four week-isodes left in a seaso-mester.</p>
<p>It's starting.</p>
<p>It's okay, guys.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Fifty thousand.</p>
<p>And I'll just put this in here.</p>
<p>Mm, mm.</p>
<p>Give it to me.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Don't help me anyone.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Turn me around.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Come on, you guys.</p>
<p>I'll see you later.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>The plan was to meet later.</p>
<p>So, what's it gonna cost to make you go away? There's a way we could end this very quickly and make a bit of money.</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>But keep talking.</p>
<p>Yes, that was the plan.</p>
<p>And your plan was probably to never show up.</p>
<p>Clever girl.</p>
<p>Don't trust anyone.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>Did you have to hit me for real? Have to? No.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Now that you're expelled you might consider a career in grifting.</p>
<p>You're quite good at it.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>How does one go through life like that? Well follow me and I'll show you.</p>
<p>Oh, shut up.</p>
<p>I only agreed to any of this to get you away from Greendale and out of Jeff's hair.</p>
<p>He's an idiot, but I hate watching him spin out trying to beat you.</p>
<p>Oh, you sentimental fool.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>At the motel.</p>
<p>The motel.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I am the king.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What the hell? Oh, shut up.</p>
<p>The only reason I agreed to any of this was to get you away from Greendale and out of Jeff's hair.</p>
<p>What the? You two.</p>
<p>Come back here.</p>
<p>Briefcases.</p>
<p>Coming right through.</p>
<p>Identical briefcases.</p>
<p>What? Why more briefcases? This is pointless.</p>
<p>I already know she's got my briefcase.</p>
<p>Briefcase parade.</p>
<p>Who the hell are you? You get back here.</p>
<p>You get back here with my money.</p>
<p>Get back here.</p>
<p>Oh, Roger.</p>
<p>They stole my money.</p>
<p>What? - What? Those briefcases contain my money.</p>
<p>They stole $50,000 from me.</p>
<p>Fifty grand, huh? - You know what he's talking about? - Don't think so.</p>
<p>These are our briefcases.</p>
<p>We're in his class.</p>
<p>He sells these supplies, 150 bucks.</p>
<p>Really, a hun? Okay.</p>
<p>We are still rolling.</p>
<p>We got pretty good at it too.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Roger, why were you walking around with $50,000? - Are you mental? - Hey.</p>
<p>Whoa, pal.</p>
<p>That usage may fly in the UK, not in the States.</p>
<p>I have a mentally challenged cousin.</p>
<p>Sister.</p>
<p>Pics.</p>
<p>I wanna see pics.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>You know very well that this school paid me $50,000 in cash for these injuries.</p>
<p>You seem to be in pretty good shape now.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Look at the two of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's the reason I became a cop.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of bullies out there.</p>
<p>There are a million witnesses to this.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hanging out in the cafeteria? Hi, Professor --</p>
<p>Oh, what happened to your face? This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Oh, she's beautiful.</p>
<p>You could be twins.</p>
<p>So the statement I'm hearing here is you're a grifting professor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Teaching these people how to grift but you're saying they grifted you? No, you id I'm not saying that.</p>
<p>They didn't grift me.</p>
<p>What they do is not grifting.</p>
<p>They wouldn't even understand the word.</p>
<p>I think we need to take what Roger's saying more seriously.</p>
<p>Because it sounds like he was either the victim of crass, artless thuggery.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>In which case there really is $50,000 floating around that he was given for clearly fake injuries and that he, therefore, now owes the school.</p>
<p>What? - Or Professor DeSalvo was targeted by a group of people he vastly underestimated.</p>
<p>In which case, the money was given and then taken back and nobody owes anybody anything.</p>
<p>All he would have to do is admit.</p>
<p>I was grifted.</p>
<p>Yeah! - Grift, grift, grift.</p>
<p>Grift, grift, grift.</p>
<p>Why are you even here? Who called you? Nobody.</p>
<p>I take macramÃ© after work.</p>
<p>They know that.</p>
<p>Sorry you got grifted.</p>
<p>Let me know if you wanna press charges and if you can think of what those would be.</p>
<p>Professor DeSalvo, under the circumstances I'm sure you agree it doesn't make sense for you to keep teaching here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we kind of know everything there is to know.</p>
<p>You should refund all of their money.</p>
<p>And we should all go get some hot dogs! Hot dogs! Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.</p>
<p>Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.</p>
<p>Hot dogs Wait.</p>
<p>We were all in on it the whole time? You weren't.</p>
<p>Because I can't be trusted.</p>
<p>Aah! Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.</p>
<p>Telegram for Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>Ridley.</p>
<p>I returned the telegram man outfit.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I know how crazy this week's been.</p>
<p>You really didn't have to do this.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? I owe you.</p>
<p>Whatever you need, say the word.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I could use your help moving a mattress this weekend.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Is that okay? - Let me know.</p>
<p>My name is Ryan Ridley.</p>
<p>Three years ago my life was saved by a stranger at my gym.</p>
<p>I felt like I owed him my life.</p>
<p>Apparently, he agreed.</p>
<p>Now he has me do things.</p>
<p>And I keep hoping and praying that one day I'll do enough for him to call us even.</p>
<p>Until then, I'm just a guy from his gym.</p>
