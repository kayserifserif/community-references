<p>Didn't they say 304? No, 303.</p>
<p>Ever down twice.</p>
<p># Troy and Abed's new apartment! #</p>
<p>Hiiii!</p>
<p>Come on in.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What a great place.</p>
<p>You guys—you guys look so fancy.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>We read a book on how to be the perfect party hosts.</p>
<p>Rule number one—dress to impress.</p>
<p>Rule number two—avoid touchy topics like the negro problem.</p>
<p>The book was written in the '40s.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, good, you guys are finally here.</p>
<p>Finally? Shirley showed up at 3:00.</p>
<p>Time flies when I'm baking.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't.</p>
<p>Oh, the door downstairs was propped open with this.</p>
<p>This is really unsafe.</p>
<p>Anyone could have just wandered into your building.</p>
<p>Like one of our guests?—I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Thank you, Troy.</p>
<p>Let me give you ladies the grand tour.</p>
<p>Bathroom, kitchen, who cares, and this is my scale model of the rolling Boulder scene from raiders With actual rolling Boulder.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>AdiÃ³s, Sapito.</p>
<p>Annie & Britta: Ahh.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? Super cool.</p>
<p>And sexy.</p>
<p>Super sexy cool.</p>
<p>Overselling it.</p>
<p>I made pizza.</p>
<p>But we ordered real pizza.</p>
<p>Well, there's nothing more real than homemade.</p>
<p>You didn't have some of the ingredients, so I used ketchup and cream cheese.</p>
<p>We ordered real pizza.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, got you that.</p>
<p>Bienvenido de la Casa Chez Trobed.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Oh, look, Indiana Jones and the apartment of perpetual virginity.</p>
<p>Chop busted, fellow adult, chop busted.</p>
<p>It's nice.</p>
<p>Not mansion-nice, but it's nice.</p>
<p>Didn't you used to live in a mansion with me? Yeah, but this is more my speed and century.</p>
<p>Doesn't bother me.</p>
<p>I've hardly missed you at all since I had you removed from my portraits.</p>
<p>Jeff! Check it out.</p>
<p>Serbian rum.</p>
<p>So strong it is banned there.</p>
<p>Banned in Serbia, Jeff.</p>
<p>Let that concept sink in.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you enjoy.</p>
<p>I have to leave early.</p>
<p>Oh?—Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>I've got an invite to the opening of a new club.</p>
<p>Look at this place.</p>
<p>It's like it was designed for me.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>I made that in Photoshop and mailed it to you a month ago so that you'd keep tonight open on your calendar.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as single malt platinum boobs and billiards club? I guess I never said it out loud.</p>
<p>Tonight we offer something far more than boobs and billiards.</p>
<p>What?—One word, two syllables.</p>
<p>Don't say charades.</p>
<p>Yahtzee! Is charades off the table? Come on.</p>
<p>And Okay.</p>
<p>Now "How to play Yahtzee." </p>
<p>Is there nothing from our youth that these companies won't repackage for a buck? Call it Yahtzee all you want.</p>
<p>Everybody knows it's Puerto Rican chess.</p>
<p>Annie, it's just the pizza.</p>
<p>We can't buzz him up.</p>
<p>Someone has to go down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>One, two—Annie.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going down.</p>
<p>All this talk of going down Did you guys know I had sex with Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom? We're about to eat.</p>
<p>It's not namedropping if it comes up organically.</p>
<p>I'm gonna check in on my pies.</p>
<p>Roxa——No.</p>
<p>Bathroom? Over here.</p>
<p>Uh, guys? What does a pregnancy test look like? Like a thin piece of plastic with a thing on the end of it.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is definitely a gun.</p>
<p>Whoa! Yeah, put that away.</p>
<p>Oh, my—Why does Annie have a gun? That's not a gun, that's a girl's peashooter.</p>
<p>Here, Troy.</p>
<p>Happy housewarming.</p>
<p>Jeff, what are we gonna do about this? I'm gonna get a drink.</p>
<p>Ow! What's so funny? I don't know, people hitting their heads.</p>
<p>Don't fight over them.</p>
<p>Well, y-you can fight a little.</p>
<p>Smells weird.</p>
<p>I beg your pardon? Smells weird.</p>
<p>What did you do? Abed, you don't ask someone a question like that.</p>
<p>It's not dignified.</p>
<p>Pizza! Pizza, pizza, go in tummy  me so hung-ee me so hung-ee  That pizza guy was super creepy.</p>
<p>So you're saying he was a pizza guy? I wonder what happened in those other timelines.</p>
<p>Abed, there are no other timelines.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four—Shirley.</p>
<p>Okay, just don't let my pies burn.</p>
<p>Remember, no one eats those pies.</p>
<p>Come on, let's just talk to her.</p>
<p>We tried that, Annie, but she ignored us.</p>
<p>The woman has a baking problem.</p>
<p>Now, I-I don't like being the bad guy anymore than anybody else—- Roxa——No.</p>
<p>Bathroom? Yeah, over here.</p>
<p>We have a pact.</p>
<p>We do not enable her baking.</p>
<p>It's gonna be better for her in the long run.</p>
<p>Heh, you know who got it in the long run.</p>
<p>Eartha Kitt, when I nailed her in the airplane bathroom.</p>
<p>Ew, Pierce.</p>
<p>What? Came up organically.</p>
<p>Here, Troy.</p>
<p>Happy housewarming.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Thanks, Pierce.</p>
<p>What is it? What? It's a traditional Norwegian troll.</p>
<p>When Troy and I were living together, I had it on display in the hall.</p>
<p>You know, outside his bedroom.</p>
<p>He seemed very taken with it.</p>
<p>It used to watch me sleep! Pierce, shame on you.</p>
<p>Jeff, what are you gonna do about this? I'm gonna get a drink.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my God! Are you okay? Barely felt it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna look at it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>It's not dignified.</p>
<p>Pizza! Pizza, pizza in my tummy  me so hung-ee me so hung-ee  Did someone remember to take out my pies? Seriously? Oh! Oh! Oh, no.</p>
<p>Seriously? Shirley, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>We weren't gonna eat them.</p>
<p>You're not allowed to have "baking things" as an identity.</p>
<p>Excuse me for being the only married woman in a group full of horny toads who sit around all night just making googly eyes at each other.</p>
<p>Googly eyes? Shirley, it's okay.</p>
<p>Nobody makes googly eyes at me either.</p>
<p>We're the same.</p>
<p># Roxanne #</p>
<p>Adiós, Sapito.</p>
<p>I don't know why she's so upset.</p>
<p>Her pies probably didn't burn in the other timelines.</p>
<p>Abed, Shirley just had a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>More like a nervous—- Bakedown! I know! I didn't say it on purpose.</p>
<p>And Abed, there are no other timelines.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating—six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>One, two, three—Pierce.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Speaking of crap, I was taking one in an airplane bathroom when Eartha Kitt decided to bang me.</p>
<p>What? It's where my mind went.</p>
<p>Your mind went years ago.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I'm gonna check on my pies.</p>
<p>Roxa——No.</p>
<p>Bathroom? Yeah, over here.</p>
<p>I love your place, Troy.</p>
<p>You're all grown up now.</p>
<p>I can't believe those are real mahogany bunk beds in there.</p>
<p>I bet that cost you a few allowances.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Aww! Troy.</p>
<p>Now we done it.</p>
<p>Britta's in the bath—AdiÃ³s, Sapito.</p>
<p>Who is it?—Troy.</p>
<p>Um, I'm washing my hands.</p>
<p>Good, then I can come in.</p>
<p>Oh, hi! Um, I was smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>I know what you were doing.</p>
<p>I'm 21 years old.</p>
<p>I'm a man.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>We all know that.</p>
<p>Then why is Jeff always picking on me? You seem to be a little hard on Troy lately.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a drink.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my God, are you okay? I barely felt it.</p>
<p>Well, let me look at it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Britta's in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Oh, um—oh, no, what happened? Minor head wound.</p>
<p>If there's an abrasion, we'll clean it with iodine and apply ice.</p>
<p>You make a good nurse.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Dr. Shirley says mini pies are the best medicine.</p>
<p>Then I'd like to see her degree.</p>
<p>He's butting antlers with you because you're a threat now.</p>
<p>You've got your own place, you've got a future, you've got a bowl full of olives next to the toilet.</p>
<p>It's a fancy party, Britta.</p>
<p>You know what Jeff has in his bathroom? Neither do I.</p>
<p>He keeps his toiletries in a safe under the sink.</p>
<p>His whole personality is based around guarding himself.</p>
<p>You don't have to be like that to be a man.</p>
<p>You're really cool, Britta.</p>
<p>Man, pizza guys are getting worse and worse-looking.</p>
<p>Guess all the good ones went into porn.</p>
<p>Ceiling fan.</p>
<p>I miss all the fun.</p>
<p>I wonder what happened in all those other timelines.</p>
<p>Troy & Britta: Who cares? Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, six—Britta.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>You know what's great? Air travel.</p>
<p>I've flown a lot, a lot of airplane stories.</p>
<p>I once had sex with Eartha Kitt—Okay, I'm gonna check on my pies.</p>
<p>You guys are my best—I'm gonna get a drink.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my God, are you okay? Barely felt it.</p>
<p>Let me look at it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Do I need to refill the toilet olives?—We're good.</p>
<p>I checked.</p>
<p>You're the best.</p>
<p>Want to stay up all night talking in our bunk beds? Duh-doy.</p>
<p>Here, Troy.</p>
<p>Happy housewarming.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Thanks, Pierce.</p>
<p>You make a good nurse, Annie.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I actually had to apply a tourniquet the other day.</p>
<p>A guy got stabbed outside my building—What? Annie, you've got to get the hell out of that apartment.</p>
<p>You don't have to treat me like a kid anymore, remember? Yeah, but adults still need to be protected.</p>
<p>I-I can't help but worry about you, Annie.</p>
<p>You're important to me.</p>
<p>Feel the terror! Stop the tantrum! Feel the terror of the Norwegian troll! What's going on in here? Pierce is terrorizing Troy because he's jealous we moved in together.</p>
<p>You're the one who's jealous.</p>
<p>Why would I be jealous? Because you're lonely and crazy.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, this is Toby, our pizza delivery guy.</p>
<p>And I know this is gonna sound nuts, but we're in love and we're getting married.</p>
<p>I wonder what happened in all those other timelines.</p>
<p>Wait, there are other timelines? Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go as fast as I can so I don't miss anything.</p>
<p>AdiÃ³s, Sapito.</p>
<p>You know who I used to call miss anything? Eartha Kitt.</p>
<p>What? He totally set me up.</p>
<p>I'm gonna check in on my pies.</p>
<p>Roxa——No.</p>
<p>Bathroom?—Yeah, over here.</p>
<p>Jeff, tell us about your father.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a drink.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my God, are you okay? Barely felt it.</p>
<p>Well, let me look at it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>What the hell? No! Call 911! Abed, help me stop the bleeding! I'm dying!—Pierce.</p>
<p>I am dying.</p>
<p>You don't have to put on the red light  Water.</p>
<p>Water! Water! Breathe, breathe.</p>
<p>Put on the red light  put on the red light  You.</p>
<p>Put on the red light  Nooooooo! Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Jeff you are now creating six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five—Abed.</p>
<p>I'm on it.</p>
<p>You know who else was on it? And do you know what "it" is? Everybody give me money.</p>
<p>Wow, that ascot really softens your personality.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I banged Eartha Kitt.</p>
<p>Roxa——No.</p>
<p>Bathroom? Down the hall.</p>
<p>I'm getting a drink.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my God, are you okay? Barely felt it.</p>
<p>Well, let me look at it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Britta's in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Oh, no, what happened? Minor head wound.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What smells amazing? Oh! Someone wants pie! You make a good nurse.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>They taste just like regular-size pies.</p>
<p>Oh, yay! Happy housewarming.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Thanks, Pierce.</p>
<p>Hey, while we're alone, I just wanted to say, thanks for letting me live with you.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like making desserts is the only thing I'm good for in the group.</p>
<p>But now it's time for me to try and make it on my own.</p>
<p>Just like you did.</p>
<p>I can't help but worry about you, Annie.</p>
<p>Hey, I don't think you should open this.</p>
<p>No, what—what are you talking about? You're very important to me.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>I was not supposed to eat your stuff.</p>
<p>We all made an agreement.</p>
<p>Crap, I was not supposed to say that out loud! Crap, okay, cards on the table, I'm really high right now.</p>
<p>Seriously!—Would you stop and give me—No, I wanna give you something else.</p>
<p>A waterpik! A speedboat! Two waterpiks.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm feeding my pies to a drug addict! Drug addict? You're a pie pusher! You push pies to get love.</p>
<p>Give it, Pierce! It feels fun! I'm sorry, I just had a weird dÃ©jÃ  vu.</p>
<p>You're bad at gift-giving! That thing you said about worrying about me It's something my dad always said.</p>
<p>I demand to be housewarmed! Shouldn't have brought it up.</p>
<p>Just reminded me of my dad.</p>
<p>Anyway Stop.</p>
<p>A little Make Out 101.</p>
<p>Less dad talk.</p>
<p>And, uh, you could ease up on the bubblegum lip gloss.</p>
<p>No, I really—No, you—! Pizza time.</p>
<p>Give me this, you godless hippie skank! You're a sick, sad, twisted old man.</p>
<p>And I hope you die alone.</p>
<p>I wonder what happened in all those other timelines.</p>
<p>I gotta say, I hope this is the real one, because I just found a nickel in the hallway.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating—six different timelines.</p>
<p>Of course I am, Abed.</p>
<p>I don't think you should.</p>
<p>Chaos already dominates enough of our lives.</p>
<p>The universe is an endless raging sea of randomness.</p>
<p>Our job isn't to fight it, but to weather it—together.</p>
<p>On the raft of life.</p>
<p>A raft held together by those few rare, beautiful things that we know to be predictable.</p>
<p>Ropes? Vines.</p>
<p>Vines? Let him finish! Us.</p>
<p>It won't matter what happens to us as long as we stay honest and accepting of each ether's flaws and virtues.</p>
<p>Annie will always be driven.</p>
<p>Shirley will always be giving.</p>
<p>Pierce will never apologize.</p>
<p>Britta's sort of a wild card from my perspective.</p>
<p>And Jeff will forever remain a conniving son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p>Abed! There are six sides to this die and seven of us.</p>
<p>He devised a system by which he never has to get the pizza.</p>
<p>Jeff!—Really? Dang, man.</p>
<p>You crafty jackrabbit.</p>
<p>Asshole.</p>
<p>Pretty low, dude.</p>
<p>It's called friendship, look it up.</p>
<p>Encarta it.</p>
<p>I think we just found our pizza-getter.</p>
<p>Yes, we did! Oh, like it matters who goes.</p>
<p>Ow! What's so funny? Karma.</p>
<p>That guy sucks harder than the toilet in an airplane bathroom.</p>
<p>Airplane bathroom—oh, my pies!</p>
<p># Roxanne #</p>
<p># Oh! You don't have to put on the red light #</p>
<p># Ooh! those days are over #</p>
<p># You don't have to sell your body to the night #</p>
<p># Sing, Britta! #</p>
<p>I really love your place.</p>
<p>You should move here.</p>
<p># Walk the streets for money # # You don't care if it's wrong #</p>
<p># Or if it is right #</p>
<p># Roxanne #</p>
<p># You don't have to put on the red light #</p>
<p># You guys see what happens when I leave you alone, huh? #</p>
<p># You don't have to put on the red light #</p>
<p># Put on the red light #</p>
<p># Put on the red light #</p>
<p>Go, Abed!</p>
<p># Put on the red light #</p>
<p># Put on the red light #</p>
<p>To Pierce.</p>
<p>May he rest in Pierce.</p>
<p>Shirley, don't you think you've had enough? Of you.</p>
<p>Guys, I've been thinking about that night over and over.</p>
<p>One thing has become clear.</p>
<p>This is the darkest, most terrible timeline.</p>
<p>Enough with the timeline crap, Abed! Pierce got shot in the leg and died! Shirley's a drunk.</p>
<p>Annie's locked in a mental ward because her guilt drove her insane.</p>
<p>Jeff lost an arm in the fire.</p>
<p>Troy lost his larynx because, for some dumb reason, he tried to destroy a flaming troll doll by eating it.</p>
<p>Clearly you don't understand anything about defeating trolls.</p>
<p>Life has gone to hell, Abed.</p>
<p>This is real! Look at us.</p>
<p>Look at me! Britta, you put one wash-away blue streak in your hair.</p>
<p>And I lost an arm.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Life got dark.</p>
<p>And all because Jeff rolled a one.</p>
<p>Oh, I love how this is my fault somehow.</p>
<p>It's mine.</p>
<p>I've run over that night over and over in my head, and I keep coming back to one thought.</p>
<p>I should've caught the die and not let you roll it.</p>
<p>I failed to do that and we all suffered for it.</p>
<p>But I'm gonna make it up to you.</p>
<p>What is this? Of all the timelines, this is clearly the darkest, which is why I propose we commit to being evil.</p>
<p>I made us all black goatees out of felt.</p>
<p>I suggest you put them on until you're able to grow your own.</p>
<p>From now on, I am evil Abed.</p>
<p>We're the evil study group, and we have but one evil goal.</p>
<p>Return somehow to the prime timeline, the one that I stopped you from rolling that die, then we destroy the good versions of ourselves, and reclaim our proper lives.</p>
<p>Evil Abed.</p>
<p>Mm-hm? As evil Jeff, am I allowed to pull fewer punches with you?—Certainly.</p>
<p>I hate you! Shut up with your Sci-Fi crap! I lost my damn arm, and you're making fake beards! Goatees.</p>
<p>evil Troy and evil Abed  What's wrong? I don't know.</p>
<p>I guess nothing.</p>
<p></p>
