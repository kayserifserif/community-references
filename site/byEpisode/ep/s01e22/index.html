<p>Hey, Britta, what are you gonna knitta? Good mood, bad rhyme and is that a carb on your plate? I got a B on my nutrition final and I am celebrating with pie and a dollop of whipped irony.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I'm knitting something for my new cat.</p>
<p>It's been two weeks since I lost Suzie B, so I figured it was time to move on.</p>
<p>Not being an animal lover, I assume it'll nice to start over with a fresh kitten.</p>
<p>Fresh kitten? I go to a shelter and rescue an animal that genuinely needs my help, okay? Why do you think I am knitting a tiny, little eye patch? Excuse me, hi.</p>
<p>We're in high school but we're taking classes for college credit.</p>
<p>Well, all right.</p>
<p>Way to be go-getters.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>So we were just wondering, can you tell us exactly what you did in your lives to end up here so that we don't make the same mistakes? Yeah, because if I end up 35 and celebrating a B in nutrition in community college, I'll kill myself.</p>
<p>Watch it.</p>
<p>Yeah, watch it.</p>
<p>Or what, schmitty? Schmitty.</p>
<p>You gonna knit me something sad in your house full of cats with no furniture? Listen, it is a studio apartment and knitting is hip.</p>

<p>Why are you letting a bunch of teenagers get to you? I don't even remember what they said.</p>
<p>It just rolled Would you stop tuning that guitar? You are 105 years old! Tell me what you did with your life to end up here so I don't make the same mistakes! Excuse me! But it's springtime and I thought I might woo a few chicks.</p>

<p>A reference my ears applaud.</p>
<p>I couldn't resist.</p>
<p>Smashing the guitar of someone singing a love song was on my quintessential college experience list.</p>
<p>Your what? It's a list of everything movies have taught me comprises a successful first year at college.</p>
<p>"Bond with a group of lovable misfits." </p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>"Take on the school bully." </p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>"Make out with the hottest girl." </p>
<p>Check-a-rooni.</p>
<p>You? No.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the school year is almost over and there's stuff left on the list.</p>
<p>I'll help you finish it.</p>

<p>The what? Stand up for a second.</p>
<p>Come over here.</p>
<p>Stand there.</p>
<p>Okay, turn around.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What the hell? Pantsing someone was on my list.</p>
<p>It would've been better if you were wearing the giant hearts underwear, but I'll take it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Well, I hope getting pantsed is on your list.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>What's so funny? This.</p>
<p>Ooh! Get it? Finally.</p>
<p>No, Pierce.</p>
<p>Shirley is way too angry to talk to you right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, you'll have to apologize later.</p>
<p>Apologize for what? She should apologize to me.</p>
<p>She ruined my joke.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>There's a grandpa schlip-schlap.</p>
<p>Have you seen my schmitty, sonny? Help me, I'm gonna crap my pants.</p>
<p>Someone help me.</p>
<p>Seriously, nutrition, this is your life? Actually, I was a lawyer.</p>
<p>Looks like that went well.</p>
<p>And now you hang out with schlip-schlap and schlap-skank -- oh, my God, is she wearing a Discman? How could you do this to me? What? Discmans are retro.</p>
<p>Oh, is retro when you're 30 and broke and can't afford an iPod, schmitty? I think "schmitty" means loser.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>You may come back in now.</p>
<p>I have something to say.</p>
<p>This better be a good apology.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>We have joked and rolled eyes at him.</p>
<p>But there has been a transgression today.</p>
<p>And I will no longer continue to be a part of the group with this man.</p>
<p>Just skip to the "I'm sorry." </p>
<p>You are pathological and you will never change.</p>
<p>Ha! That is the pot calling the kettle a kettle, okay? Oh, you can say black, Pierce.</p>
<p>I'm a black woman.</p>
<p>The cat is out the bag.</p>
<p>You have literally identified me to strangers as "the black woman." </p>
<p>Out of context.</p>
<p>Context is everything.</p>
<p>I call the other women "flat-butt" and "the one Abed wants to nail." </p>
<p>Is that you? Not me.</p>
<p>So, what's the context for constantly referring to me as a lesbian? If the wallet chain fits I'm just trying to help you find yourself.</p>
<p>At least he doesn't think Shirley's my mom anymore.</p>
<p>He thinks we're cousins.</p>
<p>You're not? He still assumes I'm a terrorist.</p>
<p>If you're not, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>If you are, I'm a hero.</p>
<p>I'm willing to take that chance.</p>
<p>You said I have a crafty Jew brain.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how to take a compliment anymore.</p>
<p>Look, either he leaves the group or I do.</p>
<p>You just dug your own grave.</p>
<p>Hey, what's up? They kicked me out of the group.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Wanna buy some cookies? Ten bucks a box.</p>
<p>Crap, damn it.</p>
<p>Have you seen a Chinese kid? Twerps.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Pierce.</p>
<p>How is it going? Unrepentant child.</p>
<p>Such a child.</p>
<p>Oh, here comes stinky turd face.</p>
<p>Remember, we don't stop till he's crying.</p>
<p>Oh, check out Franken-mom.</p>
<p>Oh, we can use that.</p>
<p>And no wedding ring.</p>
<p>He's a child of divorce.</p>
<p>We can make fun of him for coming from a broken home.</p>
<p>I don't care if this gets dirty.</p>
<p>He asked for it.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Get ready to meet Jeff Winger, esquire, attorney at "Ah, snap." </p>
<p>It will be better than that.</p>

<p>Bringing a goat to our study group, that's a great idea, Troy.</p>
<p>Thanks, must have been hard for you to say that.</p>
<p>It's called sarcasm, Troy.</p>
<p>Ask the goat to explain it to you.</p>
<p>Why do I feel like I'm being dissed? Because you are being dissed.</p>
<p>Why are you two dissing Troy? They no longer have Pierce.</p>
<p>What? Pierce's universally recognized social flaws made him the scapegoat, a lightning rod.</p>
<p>Now he's gone, so there's lightning everywhere.</p>
<p>Sounds dangerous.</p>
<p>My uncle was struck by lightning.</p>
<p>You'd think it'd give superpowers, but now he just masturbates in theaters.</p>
<p>It's very dangerous.</p>

<p>Man, that show is sloppy.</p>
<p>What's gonna happen? It's only a matter of time before one of us becomes the new Pierce.</p>
<p>Well, I sure as hell am not gonna be the new Pierce.</p>
<p>And if all we need is an escape-goat, I think we should just let this one go.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you've got to be pretending, Troy.</p>
<p>Maybe the new Pierce is Britta.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>How do you pronounce bagel again? Bagel.</p>
<p>She calls bagels, bagels.</p>
<p>We do make fun of a lot of what you do and say.</p>
<p>Yeah, right to my face, because I can take it, unlike a certain someone else.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Let's not make fun of Annie.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I don't want pity.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, after Pierce, you're the most bigoted.</p>
<p>What? You found out I was Jewish, you invited me to a "pool" party.</p>
<p>Turned out to be a baptism.</p>
<p>Excuse me for trying to sneak you into heaven.</p>
<p>What about Abed? Abed's weird.</p>
<p>No, that's not it.</p>
<p>He's all right, we like Abed.</p>
<p>Guys, have you considered the new Pierce concept is stupid? Spoken like the new Pierce.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I am not the new Pierce.</p>
<p>You are too.</p>
<p>You said "the World Wide Web." </p>
<p>Damn the old Pierce.</p>
<p>He makes me mad.</p>
<p>Don't double Pierce me.</p>
<p>You're the triple Pierce.</p>
<p>That's so unfair.</p>
<p>Guys, guys.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm gonna utter these words, but we need Pierce in this group.</p>
<p>But we can't ask Shirley to let him back in, that would be so insensitive.</p>
<p>Well, maybe he'll admit he's wrong.</p>
<p>Two, three, four, uh, not.</p>
<p>We need Pierce.</p>
<p>Just stick to the script and make it sincere.</p>
<p>It's not gonna be sincere, I'm pretending to apologize.</p>
<p>Okay, but you're not getting back into the group unless she thinks you're sincere.</p>
<p>Stubborn fool.</p>
<p>Can we, um, hurry this up? Troy and I are pledging the cool fraternity.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to us, we're the target of ridicule and don't have a chance of getting in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They're making us walk around with pretzels in our butts.</p>
<p>I put mustard on mine like an idiot.</p>
<p>Okay, Pierce, you can do this.</p>
<p>What's he? Yup.</p>
<p>Shirley, I know you don't wanna hear what I have to say, but I owe you this.</p>
<p>From the moment we first met, I knew you Seriously.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, Shirley.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>I could have You are unbelievable.</p>
<p>I'm not wearing contacts.</p>
<p>These are mine, give them.</p>
<p>But I'm a bag guy.</p>
<p>You have the same bag.</p>
<p>So I thought, you know Right, nothing is ever your fault.</p>
<p>Screw you.</p>
<p>I don't owe you an apology.</p>
<p>They wrote this.</p>
<p>Pretend like you asleep, pretend like you asleep.</p>
<p>Thank you, now I fully understand where I have always stood.</p>
<p>I'm entitled to my pride until it gets in the way of what you guys want.</p>
<p>Got nothing to say? Well, I do.</p>
<p>I'm out of the group.</p>
<p>What? Shirley.</p>
<p>Shirley, please.</p>
<p>Oh, Shirley, don't go, please.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Sassy black schmitty's out of the group.</p>
<p>Oh, no, not the group.</p>
<p>Poor, sad, little schmitties.</p>
<p>Can't all of us little schmitties get along? Would you please hurry up? I am late for my bikini wax.</p>
<p>Hurry, please.</p>
<p>Who was that? A punk-ass who needs to be destroyed.</p>
<p>And I just figured out how.</p>
<p>Can we focus on what's important here? Shirley thinks we don't care about her.</p>
<p>No, no, you're right.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>That's totally more important.</p>
<p>I just thought of one thing.</p>
<p>You need to bang that kid's mom.</p>
<p>Um, after we fix everything with Shirley.</p>
<p>Whoa! Yes, yes, yes, we'll deal with Shirley.</p>
<p>But that's brilliant! I know because then anything he says about you He'll be saying to a dude that banged his mom.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you guys.</p>
<p>Sorry, Shirley.</p>
<p>Shirley.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes! All right, bye, everybody.</p>
<p>Have a great day.</p>
<p>Be right here at 3:00, please.</p>
<p>I'll be in a hurry.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Sorry to bother you.</p>
<p>You don't happen to have an extra bottle of sports drink, do you? Actually, I do, here you go.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, got to hydrate, right? But obviously you know.</p>
<p>You work out.</p>
<p>Well, I try to keep things where they should be.</p>
<p>I think I might be where should I be.</p>
<p>I don't know about your robot, Abed.</p>
<p>Boobatron's great.</p>
<p>Once someone spills bong water on his circuitry and he comes alive, he's gonna make us the coolest guys on campus, help us get babes.</p>
<p>Those are real babes who will really laugh at us.</p>
<p>Hey, you're my friend, right? Friends are supposed to help each other no matter what.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ridiculous situation descending into heavy-handed drama for the illusion of story, check.</p>
<p>What? That was awesome.</p>
<p>All right, I am back in.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Just so you know, I'm Shirley.</p>
<p>Wouldn't want you reaching for me should you get a hankering for pancakes.</p>
<p>I'm old and I do not see well.</p>
<p>And you already won, so shut it.</p>
<p>I won? Oh, no, they want you in the group.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>So you go ahead, hang with them.</p>
<p>No, thanks, I'm sick of the way that group treats me.</p>
<p>Preaching to the choir.</p>
<p>Tell you what I'm not gonna miss.</p>
<p>Abed and Troy's silly games.</p>
<p>Grow up already.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>By the way, thanks for including me.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>You think Annie and Britta invite me when they take those weekend trips to the mall? They just think of me as some sort of mom.</p>
<p>They need to learn manners.</p>
<p>Annie needs to stop dating Vaughn.</p>
<p>He's cute, but he's not the boy I envisioned her ending up with.</p>
<p>No matter how hard you try, you can never be as cool or funny as they are.</p>
<p>It's called respect and no one ever gave me diddly.</p>
<p>Except me.</p>
<p>I respect you more than anyone else in the group.</p>
<p>Which is why you pantsed me? Well, but you see, that wasn't wrong.</p>
<p>Oh, for heaven's sake, you are such an arrogant, self-righteous ass.</p>
<p>And you are a strong, dignified woman who's raising a family.</p>
<p>A bigger accomplishment than anybody else in that room.</p>
<p>And nobody can ever strip you of that, not even me.</p>
<p>You really believe that? Yes.</p>
<p>And that's why you think pantsing me wasn't wrong? It wasn't.</p>
<p>What are you doing?! Did I misread that? Oh, here, let me just do that.</p>
<p>You sure you don't want some vodka? Oh, I'm good, I'm good.</p>
<p>I'm at school at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Did someone just take a schmitty? Hey, looks like you'll be calling somebody daddy soon.</p>
<p>Or at least your mom will be tonight.</p>
<p>Dude, you are so pathetic.</p>
<p>Mark! Mom, I've been pwning this loser.</p>
<p>He thinks he can get back at me through you.</p>
<p>What? Pwning? Pwning.</p>
<p>He doesn't even know what that means? Heh, heh.</p>
<p>I see what's going on here.</p>
<p>Look, I don't want to come between a son and his beautiful, vivacious mom.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you are pathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah, so is the whore in on it.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I gotta tell you, Chantel, you have raised a terrible human being.</p>
<p>We're better than this.</p>
<p>No, you're not.</p>
<p>I raised a winner who will continue to crush junior college losers like you.</p>
<p>Oh, schmitty.</p>
<p>Schmitty! I'm sorry, it's a matter of pride.</p>
<p>What are you looking at? "What are you looking at?" Duh! "What are you looking at?" Duh.</p>
<p>Duh! Ha, ha.</p>
<p>School his ass, Mark.</p>
<p>"School his ass, Mark." </p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Ah, leh, leh, leh.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Duh, duh, duh! Duh.</p>
<p>Duh, duh, duh.</p>
<p>Why are Jeff and Britta making fun of those handicapped kids? They don't even realize how much they need us.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? I don't know if you've noticed, but Jeff and Britta have the two most fragile egos of the group.</p>
<p>Losing to these kids will pretty much destroy them.</p>
<p>Hey! Whoa! What are you, a priest? What are you doing? What the hell? Hey, you didn't say, "Duh." </p>
<p>We win.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You're the schmitties! No, no, we're minors.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm calling the cops.</p>
<p>No, you're not.</p>
<p>You have already embarrassed me by getting pwned.</p>
<p>Don't be such a girl, now go.</p>
<p>Yeah, see that.</p>
<p>Yes, suck it! Schmitty face! We showed you, high schoolers! Suck it! Congratulations on your victory.</p>
