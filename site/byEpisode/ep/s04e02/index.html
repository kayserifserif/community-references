<p>And Andre is going as Han Solo.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>The boys are Stormtroopers and little baby Ben is an Ewok.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>You don't have enough children.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween parties.</p>
<p>You all look great.</p>
<p>Ham.</p>
<p>Pig.</p>
<p>Let me guess.</p>
<p>You're a flimsy excuse to be shirtless, wearing silk underwear.</p>
<p>And you're as wrong as you are welcome.</p>
<p>No, this year I planned a two-person costume with Annie.</p>
<p>She's going as my ring girl.</p>
<p>Pretty freaky-deaky, huh? Annie, no.</p>
<p>The boxing match ring girl.</p>
<p>The sexy ones that hold the round numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, this is why we can't just text about it, Jeff.</p>
<p>I don't watch sports.</p>
<p>There's no boxer in The Ring.</p>
<p>I don't watch scary movies.</p>
<p>"And that's why we leave the couples' costumes to the couples" she said wisely.</p>
<p>Warn your boyfriend's boyfriend.</p>
<p>We're dating.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean we do everything together.</p>
<p>You need to do some things together.</p>
<p>We do some things.</p>
<p>We do a lot of things.</p>
<p>Not all the things.</p>
<p>Things.</p>
<p>Okay, we're all here, minus Pierce, who wasn't invited to Vicki's party For reasons beyond our control or concern.</p>
<p>No mystery there.</p>
<p>She put a pencil through his face.</p>
<p>Does Vicki have a TV? It's a party.</p>
<p>No watching TV.</p>
<p>I watch Annie.</p>
<p>She watches Cougar Town reruns.</p>
<p>Makes Annie my third-favorite show.</p>
<p>And tonight is their Hallo-wine special.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Better not miss the Merlot.</p>
<p>Clink.</p>
<p>What? You fall into it.</p>
<p>That was Pierce.</p>
<p>He locked himself in his panic room.</p>
<p>He needs our help.</p>
<p>No "oh."</p>
<p>"Oh" means we are going against our will, and we are not going.</p>
<p>He's lying.</p>
<p>He seemed upset.</p>
<p>He's been alone up there in that mansion ever since I moved out and his dad, you know, got killed by Jeff.</p>
<p>Calling for help.</p>
<p>A classic call for help.</p>
<p>"Hello, Dr. Perry's office. Damaged psyche? Yes, I'll accept the charges." </p>
<p>Heads, lock up your brains.</p>
<p>Britta's on the prowl for therapy meat.</p>
<p>Maybe we should just stop by on our way to the party.</p>
<p>I assure you, the only thing Pierce is trapped in is adolescence.</p>
<p>He's a geriatric toddler throwing the most elaborate tantrums money can buy.</p>
<p>And I for one am not gonna stand by and allow some lonely ridiculous person to derail our group's plans.</p>
<p>Dean, dean, dean! To your corners, fighters.</p>
<p>Someone save me a towel.</p>
<p>You guys going to Vicki's party? We just gotta do this thing first.</p>
<p>Holy Helen, this place is huge.</p>
<p>Seems spookier than I remember.</p>
<p>The only thing spooky about this place is the tacky decor.</p>
<p>It's like David Lee Roth threw up Miami Vice.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>So tacky.</p>
<p>Maybe Pierce isn't doing so well since he lost his father and then his inheritance in a video game battle with Gilbert an illegitimate half-brother he never knew he had.</p>
<p>I guess I've never said it out loud.</p>
<p>Guys, over here.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's panic room, one of the 27 stops on the tour I had to memorize before moving into Hawthorne Manor.</p>
<p>Does the house get visitors? You're the first.</p>
<p>Impenetrable titanium carbonite door, hacker-proof key-code access panel impressive video telecom screen with remote.</p>
<p>Maximum occupancy one, with female companion.</p>
<p>Purchased June 30th, 1989.</p>
<p>It took me forever to remember that.</p>
<p>June 30th, 1989.</p>
<p>Theatrical release of Do the Right Thing.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>Wait, it might be a trap.</p>
<p>Or it might let him out.</p>
<p>Either way, we-- Oh, put a sock in it, shorts.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, guys.</p>
<p>Pierce, are you okay? Oh, sure, fine, fine.</p>
<p>I was dusting in here and I must have bumped a switch or something.</p>
<p>As the graceful one in the group, I'm kind of embarrassed.</p>
<p>Don't be.</p>
<p>I've been locked in way worse places than this.</p>
<p>Oh, not against my will.</p>
<p>Been in there long? No, not long, but I couldn't remember the damn code.</p>
<p>Sorry to be a burden on you guys, but I guess that's all I am now.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>We're happy to help.</p>
<p>No sweat, Boba Fett.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have a TV? What Abed means is did you write the code down anywhere? Yes, it's in a red notebook in my study or my bedroom, maybe.</p>
<p>I used to know where everything was before I fired my maid.</p>
<p>Now there's no reason to use my safe.</p>
<p>We'll find it.</p>
<p>It'll take two secs.</p>
<p>Or we take one sec and just skip to the catch.</p>
<p>This place hasn't been dusted in months.</p>
<p>He starts with the panic room? No sale.</p>
<p>He's not a sad old man.</p>
<p>He's a sad old liar.</p>
<p>Jeffrey! No, no, he's right.</p>
<p>I've been lying to you.</p>
<p>The truth is, last night, I got up to get a glass of red wi-- Water, and on my way back from the cellar I saw something that scared me so badly I locked myself in here on purpose.</p>
<p>The part about not remembering the code is true.</p>
<p>I'm very thirsty.</p>
<p>Why didn't you call me sooner? I had to come up with that awesome dusting story because if you knew what spooked me you'd probably call me crazy and old.</p>
<p>No one's gonna call you, Pierce.</p>
<p>You can tell us.</p>
<p>We're here to help you.</p>
<p>I thought I saw my dad.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Looked like his face was coming right through the wall.</p>
<p>But that's impossible, because my dad is dead.</p>
<p>Aha! I mean, not "Aha, your dad is dead," but "Aha, I knew it." </p>
<p>Ghost dad, exploring your haunted mansion for secret codes? Nice try, Pierce.</p>
<p>You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p>What in the Scooby-Doo is happening to you people? Go to the party.</p>
<p>We'll meet you there.</p>
<p>We're gonna stay and help Pierce.</p>
<p>He doesn't need help.</p>
<p>He needs attention.</p>
<p>Are you really this naive? Am I naive? I'm sure as stuff not your sexy little ring girl.</p>
<p>I-- - Can it, ham.</p>
<p>She's also my ride.</p>
<p>Troy said-- Pierce's bedroom is the third door.</p>
<p>I didn't leave my short-term memory at Coachella.</p>
<p>Jeez, Winger, keep it above the belt.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Already forgotten.</p>
<p>This house is getting to me.</p>
<p>Kind of weird that a dead person used to live here.</p>
<p>What's weird is that a living person lived here with his parents well into his 60s then they died and he's still here like a paralyzed Peter Pan.</p>
<p>Not for long.</p>
<p>I'm gonna set my shrink ray to "daddy issues" and blast that sucker full of closure.</p>
<p>I guess it can't hurt.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Because in one way or another, therapy is always helpful.</p>
<p>No, because there's no possible way you could mess him up worse.</p>
<p>It's like practicing on a cadaver.</p>
<p>Knock yourself out.</p>
<p>This has gotta be it.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Wish I didn't have so much exposed skin.</p>
<p>Tubular.</p>
<p>I, too, lack the adjectives.</p>
<p>How does one search for a red notebook that doesn't exist without looking, touching or creating nightmares? I'll check the nightstand.</p>
<p>I'll check my messages.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Pierce keeps his dad's bow tie by his bed.</p>
<p>Yeesh.</p>
<p>Table for Siggy Freud, party of-- Britta, stop answering phones.</p>
<p>How about we ask Rip van Racism where the codes are? Don't.</p>
<p>That's not nice.</p>
<p>What? He was a tightfisted, philandering bigot who got to outlive most bridges.</p>
<p>We don't owe him reverence.</p>
<p>How about it, you old bag of dust? You got our numbers? I'm serious, stop it.</p>
<p>You don't really believe in ghosts? I'm just not so quick to rule it out.</p>
<p>I believe people can be haunted by unresolved issues in their past.</p>
<p>Issues don't turn into ghosts.</p>
<p>Maybe for Pierce, they have.</p>
<p>Maybe Pierce and his dad have seriously unfinished business.</p>
<p>No, the dead can't have business.</p>
<p>They can't want or think or do.</p>
<p>It's what makes them dead.</p>
<p>It's the living who choose to be haunted.</p>
<p>Cornelius was barely a dad.</p>
<p>Now he's nothing.</p>
<p>Pierce can keep staring into that void or he can turn around, face his future like I did, and say: "Who gives a crap who my dad was? I'm my own man now." </p>
<p>Wow, pretty slick, Britta.</p>
<p>Using ghosts to trick me into opening up.</p>
<p>Too bad it didn't work.</p>
<p>Oh, man, so this is what the zone feels like.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Analyze this.</p>
<p>We don't wanna go over the same area twice, so be thorough.</p>
<p>Thorough.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>More of a burnt umber, but I won't hold that against him.</p>
<p>"Pierce Hawthorne's ideas for ladies"? Oh, please.</p>
<p>"Blond, long legs, with tennis racket. Asian Rockette. Big boobs, redhead, but doctor, question mark." </p>
<p>Oh, he's not 100 percent on that one? This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't have the codes.</p>
<p>Maybe Shirley and Troy are having better luck in the library.</p>
<p>Abed? Abed? If this is supposed to be like that part in that movie that's like this, I would like to remind you that I don't watch scary movies, and therefore cannot appreciate the homage! Abed? I hate reference humor.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I've been offended by this coat rack before.</p>
<p>Are we going in circles? Okay.</p>
<p>So maybe I spent a little less time in the library than, say, the walk-in cereal closet, but it's definitely near here.</p>
<p>Skipped this door.</p>
<p>Pierce told me not to go in there.</p>
<p>Then it's probably the library.</p>
<p>Racist son of a-- Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>It's Pierce's special gym.</p>
<p>He never let me use it because he thinks I'm a child.</p>
<p>Hold-- He's hiding the indoor swing and I'm the child.</p>
<p>No, Troy, get out of there.</p>
<p>Why does he have so many collars? - Secret dogs.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Forget you saw that, and then forget I knew what it was.</p>
<p>You won't tell me, Pierce won't tell me.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to Google.</p>
<p>I'll never know.</p>
<p>Dating Britta, you'll know too much too soon, soon enough.</p>
<p>What does Britta have to do with this? Well, she's a modern woman, with experienced tastes.</p>
<p>I think it's nice you two are dating.</p>
<p>I hope she doesn't make you feel pressured.</p>
<p>Pressured to what? To fulfill her expectations.</p>
<p>Expectations of what? Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>
<p>Unsatisfied with what? I lost Abed.</p>
<p>I turned around and he disappeared.</p>
<p>Never let him out of your sight.</p>
<p>That goes double for holidays and wax museums.</p>
<p>How are we gonna find him? I don't know, but we have to.</p>
<p>He's probably already looking for us.</p>
<p>Oh, well, that's Hallo-wine in Cougar Town for you.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>Oh, ladies, I'll follow you anywhere.</p>
<p>I do not have daddy issues.</p>
<p>You get two minutes.</p>
<p>Denial is the first step to acceptance.</p>
<p>That can't be.</p>
<p>Says the deny-ist.</p>
<p>Not a word.</p>
<p>Keep digging.</p>
<p>Confronting your issues now could prevent you from ending up haunted like Pierce.</p>
<p>I won't be Pierce.</p>
<p>Won't you? No, I'm nothing like him.</p>
<p>Aren't you? Gonna keep doing that? Am I? The worst therapist? No, because you're not a therapist.</p>
<p>Since you're misdiagnosing by a mile, let me point out some differences.</p>
<p>Pierce was raised by his dad.</p>
<p>Mine took off when I was 8.</p>
<p>Pierce spent his life begging for scraps of his father's approval.</p>
<p>I moved on.</p>
<p>Maybe Pierce needs a dad, I don't.</p>
<p>Don't you? Stop that! Okay, if I need a dad so bad how come I've had his phone number for three weeks without the slightest urge to call him? You found your dad? Did I? Give it here! I remember when this show was about a community college.</p>
<p>No, you keep the fish sticks, senator.</p>
<p>Enjoy the boat show.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Just let me see the number! No! For medical purposes! Help me heal your heart hole! Never! Jeffrey! So this is where Pierce has been hiding the taste.</p>
<p>Here's to you, Cornelius.</p>
<p>Gone, but not forgiven.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Otherwise it wouldn't be pointless.</p>
<p>This is pointless.</p>
<p>We have no Abed, no codes.</p>
<p>Pierce sent us on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>Jeff was right.</p>
<p>I am naive.</p>
<p>Oh, don't listen to him.</p>
<p>Nothing naive about helping a friend.</p>
<p>Jeff would know that if he wasn't too cool for after-school specials.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Abed's here.</p>
<p>I can feel him.</p>
<p>Maybe we should loop back to the indoor swing room.</p>
<p>Indoor swing? That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Someone's gonna break a lamp.</p>
<p>Break something on it.</p>
<p>Britta, while I applaud your gentle approach to psychoanalysis, I'm not gonna talk about it.</p>
<p>Hey, cut it out! You're gonna break the door.</p>
<p>Well, look who came crawling back.</p>
<p>Not crawling, walking.</p>
<p>Quite briskly.</p>
<p>Follow.</p>
<p>I like talking to you, Annie.</p>
<p>It's easy.</p>
<p>I hope you feel like you can talk to me too.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Spit it out.</p>
<p>No secrets between roomies.</p>
<p>Behind you.</p>
<p>I'm behind you too.</p>
<p>Hands.</p>
<p>Wall! Not sure where you're going here, but just let it out.</p>
<p>Don't let it out! Don't let it out! All right, Pierce, turn off your haunted house! Oh, my God, Pierce is dead.</p>
<p>Cornelius killed him.</p>
<p>I broke the remote! Do you think it's expensive? Please, Pierce.</p>
<p>Please, don't die slightly before your time.</p>
<p>This means we're next, and I care about us.</p>
<p>Where-- ? Gotcha! What the hell? I totally had you guys convinced I was dead.</p>
<p>That'll teach you to value my presence.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Don't Pierce me.</p>
<p>You were going to Vicki's party without me.</p>
<p>Bet you didn't expect me to fake a haunted house to teach you a lesson.</p>
<p>Exactly what we expected.</p>
<p>Pierce, Vicki's the one that didn't invite you.</p>
<p>Why didn't you scare her? Because I hate her.</p>
<p>Abed, where have you been? I found Pierce's secret surveillance room.</p>
<p>He was faking a haunted house.</p>
<p>Abed Nadir with the late report.</p>
<p>Sorry, good montages take time.</p>
<p>Man, it was so easy.</p>
<p>Some shadows, a couple of mirror tricks.</p>
<p>A little custom-built latex walls and you're all crapping in your short pants.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive, particularly the figure you hired to watch you sleep.</p>
<p>Wow, that is creepy.</p>
<p>Standout performance.</p>
<p>Is he SAG? What are you doing? I didn't hire anyone.</p>
<p>Enough, Pierce.</p>
<p>Just open the damn door.</p>
<p>There's no ghost.</p>
<p>How do you explain this? You probably asked someone to help you with your stupid prank and then forgot.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>

<p>Don't you? Stop that! Okay, if I need a dad so bad how come I've had his phone number for three weeks without the slightest urge to call him? You found your dad? Did I? Give it here! I remember when this show was about a community college.</p>
<p>No, you keep the fish sticks, senator.</p>
<p>Enjoy the boat show.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Just let me see the number! No! For medical purposes! Help me heal your heart hole! Never! Jeffrey! So this is where Pierce has been hiding the taste.</p>
<p>Here's to you, Cornelius.</p>
<p>Gone, but not forgiven.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Otherwise it wouldn't be pointless.</p>
<p>This is pointless.</p>
<p>We have no Abed, no codes.</p>
<p>Pierce sent us on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>Jeff was right.</p>
<p>I am naive.</p>
<p>Oh, don't listen to him.</p>
<p>Nothing naive about helping a friend.</p>
<p>Jeff would know that if he wasn't too cool for after-school specials.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Abed's here.</p>
<p>I can feel him.</p>
<p>Maybe we should loop back to the indoor swing room.</p>
<p>Indoor swing? That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Someone's gonna break a lamp.</p>
<p>Break something on it.</p>
<p>Britta, while I applaud your gentle approach to psychoanalysis, I'm not gonna talk about it.</p>
<p>Hey, cut it out! You're gonna break the door.</p>
<p>Well, look who came crawling back.</p>
<p>Not crawling, walking.</p>
<p>Quite briskly.</p>
<p>Follow.</p>
<p>I like talking to you, Annie.</p>
<p>It's easy.</p>
<p>I hope you feel like you can talk to me too.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Spit it out.</p>
<p>No secrets between roomies.</p>
<p>Behind you.</p>
<p>I'm behind you too.</p>
<p>Hands.</p>
<p>Wall! Not sure where you're going here, but just let it out.</p>
<p>Don't let it out! Don't let it out! All right, Pierce, turn off your haunted house! Oh, my God, Pierce is dead.</p>
<p>Cornelius killed him.</p>
<p>I broke the remote! Do you think it's expensive? Please, Pierce.</p>
<p>Please, don't die slightly before your time.</p>
<p>This means we're next, and I care about us.</p>
<p>Where-- ? Gotcha! What the hell? I totally had you guys convinced I was dead.</p>
<p>That'll teach you to value my presence.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Don't Pierce me.</p>
<p>You were going to Vicki's party without me.</p>
<p>Bet you didn't expect me to fake a haunted house to teach you a lesson.</p>
<p>Exactly what we expected.</p>
<p>Pierce, Vicki's the one that didn't invite you.</p>
<p>Why didn't you scare her? Because I hate her.</p>
<p>Abed, where have you been? I found Pierce's secret surveillance room.</p>
<p>He was faking a haunted house.</p>
<p>Abed Nadir with the late report.</p>
<p>Sorry, good montages take time.</p>
<p>Man, it was so easy.</p>
<p>Some shadows, a couple of mirror tricks.</p>
<p>A little custom-built latex walls and you're all crapping in your short pants.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive, particularly the figure you hired to watch you sleep.</p>
<p>Wow, that is creepy.</p>
<p>Standout performance.</p>
<p>Is he SAG? What are you doing? I didn't hire anyone.</p>
<p>Enough, Pierce.</p>
<p>Just open the damn door.</p>
<p>There's no ghost.</p>
<p>How do you explain this? You probably asked someone to help you with your stupid prank and then forgot.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>LeVar Burton was a hard no.</p>
<p>There's only one explanation.</p>
<p>I belittled my father's good name for a prank.</p>
<p>And his ghost has returned to scold me.</p>
<p>And probably butcher you guys for going along with it.</p>
<p>You think hiding in this room is gonna keep you safe? Ghosts can't go through doors, stupid.</p>
<p>They're not fire.</p>
<p>Pierce, I am paying a teenager by the hour to care about my children so I can go to this party.</p>
<p>So you have to ask yourself, is the real threat out there or in here? Fine, I'll open it myself.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>He'll scold me! Someone's punching in the code.</p>
<p>Please, tell me one of us is outside.</p>
<p>May I be of some assistance? Gilbert! Gilbert, what are you doing in my house? Well, technically it's my house.</p>
<p>After our father died, I became the sole inheritor of his estate, including all six houses and the decommissioned submarine.</p>
<p>What? - What? So you came here to kick me out? I came here to give you the deed, but on the day of my arrival, you were out.</p>
<p>I noticed mail piled up by the door.</p>
<p>I took it in, paid the overdue bills, replaced a few light bulbs, and, well, that was six weeks ago.</p>
<p>You've been living here in secret this whole time? Yes, I'm ashamed to say that after a lifetime as Cornelius's assistant, I've had a difficult time adjusting to his passing.</p>
<p>It seems his absence has taken a greater toll than his presence ever did.</p>
<p>Taking care of Pierce gave my life purpose again.</p>
<p>But now that I've been discovered by your thin friend, I must apologize and bid you adieu.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Pierce.</p>
<p>There's a load of clean socks in the dryer.</p>
<p>Gilbert, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Look, I've been doing really well since Dad died, so I don't need anyone taking care of me.</p>
<p>But if you're having a tough time, well, I guess I could use a roommate.</p>
<p>Will there be anything else, brother? Yes.</p>
<p>Bring it in.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Have fun at the party.</p>
<p>Tell Vicki I say happy Halloween.</p>
<p>That'll mess with her.</p>
<p>You don't wanna come? I've got a mask for you to wear.</p>
<p>One that doesn't zip at the mouth.</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>I'll hang around here with Gilbert.</p>
<p>He needs me.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>What was all that about masks? Don't know, don't want to.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Hey, how about you and I skip out on this party? Why? To do what and where? Oh, I was thinking you could show me some Inspector Spacetime.</p>
<p>You're always talking about it.</p>
<p>I've never seen a full episode.</p>
<p>Oh! Sure you want to? It starts pretty slow.</p>
<p>First inspector couldn't even time-travel.</p>
<p>That sounds fine.</p>
<p>After a night of running in circles trying to untie Winger knots, I'm looking for something slow.</p>
<p>Sorry I ruined your night.</p>
<p>Actually, Pierce ruined my night, but you were right to let him.</p>
<p>Still wanna go to the party? I heard Vicki bought dry ice and gave Leonard the wrong address.</p>
<p>Uh, I'll take a pass.</p>
<p>I have some unfinished business at home.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Are you in here? Abed, was that you? I wanna show you something on the other side of the bookcase.</p>
<p>Troy? Find me as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Who is in my house? Gilbert! Hijinks.</p>
<p>Indubitably.</p>
<p>Did it work? Are you tall?</p>
<p></p>
