<p>You know what? Let's just get to it.</p>
<p>How is it? Pretty good taco meat.</p>
<p>I wonder how the dean scored this sweet spread.</p>
<p>Ah-ah-ah.</p>
<p>Chef Gaga never reveals her caterer.</p>
<p>And don't try reading my pa-pa-pa-poker face.</p>
<p>It's military rations from an army surplus store.</p>
<p>I didn't read your poker face, you left the containers in the garbage.</p>
<p>Oh, well, um, you guys have fun.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go take out the garbage.</p>
<p>You may also want to adjust your iTunes setting.</p>
<p>When it's not playing an endless loop of ABBA's greatest hits, it's playing what may be your personal voice memos.</p>
<p>What? Note to self: Get oil changed.</p>

<p>No, an angel.</p>
<p>And something called Human Centi David Beckham.</p>
<p>Dragon turtle? T. Rex.</p>
<p>Man, I wonder how much effort you put into being accidentally handsome for a costume every year.</p>
<p>Half the effort you'll be putting into eating and drinking.</p>
<p>Let me help you, dragon turtle.</p>
<p>Guys, Shirley's costume is once again unwittingly ambiguous.</p>
<p>I don't know what she's supposed to be, but she's not Miss Piggy.</p>
<p>I repeat, she is not Miss Piggy.</p>
<p>You're on your own.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Guess who I am.</p>
<p>Umm.</p>
<p>Can't you just say? No.</p>
<p>Pierce, are you okay? Huh? What? Whoa.</p>
<p>Hey, if you get any more sweaty and puffy, your costume's gonna reach authenticity.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't understand.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>He's acting like the impression of him we do.</p>
<p>"What?" "Where am I?" "Where's the black boy in the uniform?" Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Get away from me! Oh, man, just when you think it's funny.</p>
<p>Pierce?</p>
<p>You know something? Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Excuse me, I think my friend is really sick.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor.</p>
<p>I'm a doctor.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Rich, from pottery class.</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Wow, this looks serious.</p>
<p>Let's get him over here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Boy, he is just not in very good shape, is he? But you look fantastic.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Look at you, with your hood.</p>
<p>Right, between -- oh, my God.</p>
<p>What is it? Get away from those hotties.</p>
<p>You're safe now.</p>
<p>If that thing comes back, I need one or both of your phone numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>How do you do it? Well, I'm wearing a $6000 suit, and you spent three days making cardboard robot armor.</p>
<p>Saying they feel sorry for you? I'm saying I remind girls less of taking their little brothers to Comic-Con.</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p>More? Put her with the others.</p>
<p>Hundred and two.</p>
<p>This may be food poisoning.</p>
<p>Rich, what did I tell you? To rule out food poisoning.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But also not to say the words out loud.</p>
<p>Who wants to walk my plank, huh? Hey.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm ruling out food poisoning.</p>
<p>Guess who I am.</p>

Wrong.</p>
<p>Kristi Yamaguchi? Peggy Fleming.</p>
<p>Just been proven racist by the racist prover.</p>
<p>Hey, guess who I am.</p>
<p>Drink.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a weird vibe taking hold of this party? It's like every fifth person is on something seriously hard-core.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder who's holding the key to your riddle.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Where's your costume? I'm trying something new.</p>
<p>But our costumes go together.</p>
<p>I'm just a guy in a spandex suit and a helmet.</p>
<p>Well, I'm a sexy Dracula.</p>
<p>You mean vampire.</p>
<p>I don't need to know which Dracula I am to be a Dracula.</p>
<p>Nerd.</p>
<p>Your symptoms are progressing even faster than everyone else's.</p>
<p>How much of that taco meat did you eat? I didn't eat any.</p>
<p>My name is Alex.</p>
<p>Must have transferred through Pierce's bite.</p>
<p>My God, I think you're right.</p>
<p>Annie, you make quite the little nurse.</p>
<p>Thank you, Rich.</p>
<p>You're quite a banana.</p>
<p>Jeez, why don't you guys just get a? But the only people getting sick are the ones eating what I bought at your surplus store.</p>
<p>I never said the stuff was delicious, but you can't get sick, it's nonperishable.</p>
<p>What about the taco meat stuff? The what? The classic flavor? Huh? The one with the goofy label.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>What goofy label? What are you?</p>
<p>"Classified Phoenix. If found, repeat key phrase, echo, tango, x-ray, nine, nine, seven." </p>
<p>Yeah, sounds delicious.</p>
<p>Anyway, it looks like taco meat and --</p>
<p>Hello? Greendale Community College? Speaking.</p>
<p>This is Special Operations Officer McHenry.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I need you to listen to me very carefully.</p>
<p>Okay, one hint.</p>
<p>I'm a beloved character from our childhood.</p>
<p>I can't stop seeing it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Leonard, behave.</p>
<p>I'm a Christian woman.</p>
<p>Leonard, you better back that pumpkin ass up or I will make a pie.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
<p>It's me, Rich, from pottery class.</p>
<p>Doc Potterywood, remember? Rich, bigger fish.</p>
<p>There's an infection at the party making people act weird and bite each other.</p>
<p>We need to coordinate an evacuation without causing unnecessary panic.</p>
<p>Holy crap, Leonard's a zombie.</p>
<p>Zombie attack! Never mind.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Um! I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Open the door! I've been told we need a little baby quarantine until the army gets here.</p>
<p>The army? I know, right? They said to wait for six hours.</p>
<p>Stay strong.</p>
<p>Guys, I hate to be the "we've got company" guy, but hey, guess who I am.</p>
<p>Or don't.</p>
<p>Head to the back! You punched a lady bee.</p>
<p>Let go of the door, you little bitch.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God you're all right.</p>
<p>Shirley, door.</p>
<p>Oh, he did it.</p>
<p>Okay, did we lose anybody out there?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is anybody hurt?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Last question, and I know it's a long shot.</p>
<p>Did anybody shut off the dean's playlist? Two percent milk, eggs, deodorant, Puppy Chow, black light, whole milk Okay.</p>
<p>Cotton swabs.</p>
<p>It's officially a waking nightmare.</p>
<p>Add Eat Pray Love soundtrack to workout mix.</p>
<p>When are the police coming?</p>
<p>Help is on the way.</p>
<p>Hello? Help is on the way.</p>
<p>Help Hello? Flavor Flav was right.</p>
<p>It's the end of days.</p>
<p>It can't be the end of days.</p>
<p>It's not 2012 yet.</p>
<p>It's not the end of days.</p>
<p>It's a rabies-related pathogen affecting the prefrontal cortex of the brain, causing hyperaggression.</p>
<p>It could take years to take over the world.</p>
<p>How many years? One, one and a half.</p>
<p>End of days, end of days.</p>
<p>Good thinking, Jeff, vertical fold.</p>
<p>You making fun of me? That jacket is worth more than the island you were grown on, Chiquita MD.</p>
<p>Chiquita MD, I like it.</p>
<p>This is a good time to let you know I hate you.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we be barricading the room? I don't know.</p>
<p>These guys don't seem so I will help you.</p>
<p>Wait, before you barricade us in, I need to ask if anyone has been bitten.</p>
<p>You bit? Huh? You bit? This pathogen is spread through bites.</p>
<p>If anyone has been bitten and you allow us to seal ourselves in here with you, you're putting us all in danger.</p>
<p>All right, go ahead.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Okay, I got the middle.</p>
<p>Barricade.</p>
<p>Are we really just gonna sit here? Army's gonna be here in six hours.</p>
<p>Why six hours?</p>
<p>Are they hosting the Oscars?</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>And the winner for Best Adapted Oscar Burn: Jeff Winger for Oh, Snap: The Man Who Went There.</p>
<p>Those people don't have six hours.</p>
<p>Judging from the temperatures, in three hours, they're gonna suffer brain damage.</p>
<p>After that, they're gonna be dead.</p>
<p>What? We have to do something for them.</p>
<p>Do something for the zombies? If we lower the temperature of the building, would it break the fever and kill the virus? It might.</p>
<p>I know where the thermostat is, out on the wall.</p>
<p>Troy, we have to rise to the occasion like Ripley and kick butt.</p>
<p>I'm not Ripley, Abed.</p>
<p>I'm a cool, sexy Dracula.</p>
<p>I make love to ladies and I survive.</p>
<p>I'm with Troy.</p>
<p>Guys, those are not zombies.</p>
<p>Those are our classmates and they're sick.</p>
<p>They can make us sick by biting us.</p>
<p>The banana said so.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>The incubation only takes minutes.</p>
<p>You get a stomachache, then your skin turns red.</p>
<p>Followed by cold sweats, muscle spasms, high fever.</p>
<p>Then the uncontrollable urge to bite uninfected flesh.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>And I forgot one symptom.</p>
<p>Slurred speech.</p>
<p>You got bit! I felt like maybe I was special.</p>
<p>Special? You're not special.</p>
<p>I'm special.</p>
<p>I was bit 10 minutes ago and I'm f--</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Nobody's special! Hey, Rich, just so you know, I hate you less now.</p>
<p>That's how much I hate your normal self.</p>
<p>You have to destroy the brain.</p>
<p>Hamster! A hamster! Way to go.</p>
<p>Run, run!</p>
<p>Head for the stairs!</p>
<p>Look out.</p>
<p>What about Annie?</p>
<p>Don't look back.</p>
<p>Why not? Oh! Shirley.</p>
<p>Don't look back.</p>
<p>We have to go help them.</p>
<p>You can't help them by getting bit.</p>
<p>It's occupied.</p>
<p>Occupied.</p>
<p>Oh, this is how I die, as Miss Piggy.</p>
<p>You're not Miss Piggy.</p>
<p>You're Glinda the Good Witch.</p>
<p>You knew? Just so you know, I've always loved Peggy Fleming.</p>
<p>You're not a racist.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Mm? Mm.</p>
<p>Get in.</p>
<p>Get in.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>A dark basement.</p>
<p>I was just thinking we should be doing this in a dark basement.</p>
<p>Troy, why did you ditch your costume? Why bring that up now, Abed? We might die down here.</p>
<p>All the more reason to get this ironed out.</p>
<p>You called me a nerd.</p>
<p>What defines a nerd? Committing to a costume with your best friend, is that what nerds do? I don't know, because I'm not a nerd, so I'm not taking part in this conversation.</p>
<p>Shh! Nerds! Did you hear that? Jeez! It was just a cat.</p>
<p>Let's keep moving.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>What is up with that cat?</p>
<p>Is someone throwing it?</p>
<p>Let's keep moving.</p>
<p>Let's not keep moving, because there is an insane cat down here.</p>
<p>But what about the zombies? Back burner, Troy.</p>
<p>This cat has to be dealt with.</p>
<p>There it is, grab it!</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Let's go through there.</p>
<p>Door should lead upstairs, the thermostat Enough with the thermostat, Abed.</p>
<p>This is not "pretend playtime, save the world" time.</p>
<p>It's quarter past "let's get the hell out of this building" time.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>There's a window.</p>
<p>If we climb that fence, we can hoist against the wall and then squeeze through it.</p>
<p>I vote we take the door.</p>
<p>He doesn't wanna dirty his suit.</p>
<p>For real? Clothes make the man, Troy.</p>
<p>What the? Hey! That's my jacket.</p>
<p>My jacket, you're stretching it.</p>
<p>You're stretching it! Go back, go back, go back.</p>
<p>Don't stop.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Move, move! Now drop down, drop down.</p>
<p>To the gate, to the gate.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>I'm not going without you.</p>
<p>Troy, make me proud.</p>
<p>Be the first black man to make it to the end.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>No! Ah! Okay.</p>
<p>Troy, be honest.</p>
<p>Are you a zombie? I will mace you.</p>
<p>Give me the keys.</p>
<p>People are gonna get brain damage if someone doesn't help.</p>
<p>Troy, there is something called chain of command, so unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>Are you crazy? How are you gonna survive those zombies? I'm gonna be a nerd.</p>
<p>Better have a plan B.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Prepare to meet the power of imagination.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't know why I thought this would work.</p>
<p>Hey, get off me! Get off.</p>
<p>You're so strong.</p>
<p>God, I hate this! Get off.</p>
<p>Stop using your mouth.</p>
<p>Hello, zombie Annie.</p>
<p>What big fists you have, in your face.</p>
<p>Beam this up, Scotty.</p>
<p>In your face.</p>
<p>Zombie Shirley.</p>
<p>I don't know what you are, but in your face! Abed, we're friends.</p>
<p>Abed, no! Ah! Britta.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I've been bit, y'all.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Congrats.</p>
<p>You did what zombies do.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Still cool as a zombie.</p>
<p>Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way!</p>
<p>Lock down perimeter!</p>
<p>We got movement inside.</p>
<p>You're Dean Pelton?</p>
<p>Speaking.</p>
<p>Wow, six hours on the dot.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>You the only witness? I am.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hey, we got uninfected in here.</p>
<p>How many are we talking? Think it might be all of them.</p>
<p>All right, scenario B.</p>
<p>Repeat, scenario B.</p>
<p>Let's dose these suckers.</p>
<p>Dose what now? Going in.</p>
<p>Go to scenario B.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't remember anything.</p>
<p>It's not bad, right?</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>You remember nothing past your decision to be Lady Gaga? I can't believe that somebody would mass-roofie an entire party.</p>
<p>I can't believe it wasn't me.</p>
<p>I can't believe I believe you.</p>
<p>And I don't.</p>
<p>Wanna watch a movie? Sure.</p>
<p>Aliens, cyborgs or zombies? I don't know why, but I'm kind of over zombies.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't feel like anything action-heavy.</p>
<p>How about something light? You seen Marmaduke? And so Troy and Abed went back to the dormitory for a viewing of Marmaduke.</p>
