<p>Thanks for a great year.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>I hope you will be seizing the day this summer.</p>
<p>Thanks, Professor Whitman.</p>
<p>And I hope you'll be seizing a more contemporary movie.</p>
<p>Looking good, Leonard.</p>
<p>Stroke or tai chi? Tai chi.</p>
<p>Keep it up.</p>
<p>And keep up whatever it is you're doing, Garrett.</p>
<p>It's called chillaxing.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Hey-hey, what's up, Jeff? Hi.</p>
<p>Hello, good morning, howdy.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Wait, Jeff.</p>
<p>I'll walk with you.</p>
<p>I'll see you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, I got class in, like, five hours, so All right, I'll see you, babe.</p>
<p>I can't believe I made it through my first year of college.</p>
<p>I finally get to click send on so many l-told-you-so e-mails.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's pretty great.</p>
<p>Not much could ruin today.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Oh, shoot.</p>
<p>I forgot saying that summons him.</p>
<p>Will you two be attending tomorrow's, uh, transfer ceremony to send off all the students leaving for so-called real schools? There's a formal dance afterward.</p>
<p>How many dances this school have? Five.</p>
<p>If you come to all of them, you get one of these.</p>
<p>I assumed your whole posse would be coming to the dance, having heard the exciting news about Britta.</p>
<p>Banana rhino.</p>
<p>Yeah, ugh Banana <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Sam Elliott</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000385'>Sam Elliott</a></span><span class='years'>1944&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>writer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715'>tt0118715</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517451'>tt1517451</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277434'>tt0277434</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206'>tt0098206</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>

<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Banana King Tut.</p>
<p>Here, give me that.</p>
<p>It's more like this.</p>
<p>Banana penis.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Sure you would've loved it if he did it.</p>
<p>What? What's happened to you and me, Troy? Remember how hard we laughed when we first heard the term teacher's aids? Yeah.</p>
<p>And then we found out a teacher did have AIDS.</p>
<p>So, what's everybody doing this summer? I'm taking the boys on a trip.</p>
<p>Money's tight, I hope I can convince them for one more year that motels are tiny little theme parks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got to find a new place to live.</p>
<p>My dad wants me to leave the nest so he feels less weird that his girlfriend's 20.</p>
<p>You could live in a pyramid.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Your dorm got a bunk bed, right? Yep.</p>
<p>Um, everyone has to go to the transfer dance tomorrow.</p>
<p>I'm going.</p>
<p>My friend Gary's transferring.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>Hope he transfers to hell.</p>
<p>More importantly, our very own Britta Perry, it turns out, has been nominated for transfer queen.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>What the hell is a transfer queen? Like prom queen.</p>
<p>You wear a sash.</p>
<p>There's a vote, and if you win they put a crown on your head.</p>
<p>And I am so jealous, I want to murder you.</p>
<p>Aren't you excited? No.</p>
<p>How did I get nominated? Don't let it upset you, Britta.</p>
<p>It's the last day of semester.</p>
<p>Nothing can ruin that.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>He's like an evil genie.</p>
<p>Just spreading the news.</p>
<p>Some folks say "transfer formal" isn't really rolling off the tongue, so we're just gonna call it the "tranny dance." </p>
<p>Much more Greendale.</p>
<p>What kind of community college has a prom? Proms weren't even cool in high school.</p>
<p>It's that kind of crap that made me drop out in the first place.</p>
<p>You know, you don't actually have to lie on a sofa like it's a <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Woody Allen</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095'>Woody Allen</a></span><span class='years'>1935&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>writer</span><span class='tag prof'>director</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097123'>tt0097123</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118954'>tt0118954</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686'>tt0075686</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079522'>tt0079522</a></span></span></span></span> movie.</p>
<p>Thank you for telling me that in the last session, dumbass.</p>
<p>Now, look, there are bugs on the windshield of your mind, you may never be able to squeegee like a certain birthday party attended by a rather enterprising transient in a dinosaur costume.</p>
<p>But there are other more recent streaks that you might yet be able to wipe clear, like your adolescent fear of being a so-called blow-up doll.</p>
<p>I really think this nomination may actually help that.</p>
<p>So you think I'd feel better about myself if I sexed up, went over there, and really tried to be crowned queen of the dingbats? Precisely.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Guess you really get what you pay for with free therapy.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>That stung a little bit.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I'll save you time.</p>
<p>He listens to you talk for a year, then recommends a makeover.</p>
<p>Well, don't wear as much lipstick as you did on Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>Your mouth looked like a coin purse.</p>
<p>Señor Chang, Greendale's foremost, if only, Spanish teacher.</p>
<p>What can I do for you? I am actually a student now.</p>
<p>But I was thinking, as a teacher, and as my friend, um, if you could help me cheat my way through school.</p>
<p>I have a counterproposal.</p>
<p>How about I point out to you we've never actually been friends, then laugh at your very well-deserved misfortune? Let's just try that a second.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>No, Jorge, you killed it.</p>
<p>Are you going to Abed's kegger? Heck, yeah.</p>
<p>You know it, jefe.</p>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p>You probably don't wanna talk to me.</p>
<p>It's not junior high.</p>
<p>We're mature adults, Michelle.</p>
<p>We can talk.</p>
<p>I think I handled our breakup poorly.</p>
<p>Before I respond to that I'll have to take an extra-strength vitamin duh.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>We started getting serious and I got scared, it's possible I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Maybe we can talk about it sometime.</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Why don't you take a picture.</p>
<p>It will last longer.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Dope kegger.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Funny.</p>
<p>You know, I spend so much time here, I forget that we don't live together.</p>
<p>Then I think, "What if we lived together?" Here, I'm gonna check on the other keg.</p>
<p>Hey, Troy, you ever seen one of these? It's called a beer bong.</p>
<p>You're not supposed to inhale though.</p>
<p>I almost died outside.</p>
<p>Why does Abed hate me? What, are you kidding? Look at him.</p>
<p>He probably hates America.</p>
<p>Hey, babe.</p>
<p>Baby, guess what.</p>
<p>Your boyfriend just got offered a spot on the number one community college Hacky Sack team in the nation.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, sweetie.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that's huge.</p>
<p>Of course it's huge.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? I mean, you know.</p>
<p>I'm not into fame and stuff, but I could be the next Vngwe Mackadangdang, Jr.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>There's one thing, mountain flower, that's that the, uh, school's in Delaware.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You know, if you don't go to this dance tomorrow, we are not gonna see each other for months.</p>
<p>It's not a Jane Austen novel.</p>
<p>We have cell phones.</p>
<p>What? Aah, oh.</p>
<p>Oh, jeez, sorry.</p>
<p>What are you doing? You had hair I was gonna move.</p>
<p>You were gonna move my hair? I don't know.</p>
<p>Ever thought of yourself as a guarded person, Britta? Am I? Watch.</p>
<p>Ow! See? It's alarming, right? Right? Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, Professor Slater, hi.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? Oh, you know, end of the year, randomly wandering.</p>
<p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
<p>Are you two? No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The two of you aren't? No.</p>
<p>No, just friends.</p>
<p>Same here.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Will I see you at the dance, Britta? Kind of obligated, seeing as I'm nominated for queen, so -- oh.</p>
<p>I thought you were all into female empowerment.</p>
<p>What's more empowering than a woman in a crown? Just did my first keg stand.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Can't feel my legs.</p>
<p>Uhn.</p>
<p># Dancing in your underwear #</p>
<p># Taking air conditioner repair #</p>
<p># So you can get a job #</p>
<p># Greendale's the way it goes #</p>
<p>Whoo! Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Our original school song by the venerable Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>He made that up.</p>
<p>Hmm? Everyone remember to vote before the coronation.</p>
<p>The nominees are identified with sashes that say, "Tranny Queen." </p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>By the way, we do offer summer classes, which are a great way to, um, um, broaden your mind.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You're here for me.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>Vaughn got recruited to a college in Delaware.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go with him for the summer.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>A classic last-day-of-school plot twist.</p>
<p>He's gonna be the next Vngwe Mackadangdang, Jr.</p>
<p>It's a Hacky Sack guy.</p>
<p>Hey, you don't have to tell us who Ingmar Mackadingdong, Jr. is.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Jeff, help me with some refreshments.</p>
<p>Please don't tell anyone until after I'm gone.</p>
<p>I'm not just going to Delaware for the summer.</p>
<p>I'm transferring with Vaughn.</p>
<p>What? When did you decide that? I spent three months researching backpacks before I chose the one that I use now.</p>
<p>I don't want to be that person anymore.</p>
<p>I want to live in the moment.</p>
<p>Well, for your and Vaughn's sake, I hope it works out.</p>
<p>But on behalf of the rest of the group, I hope it's a catastrophe.</p>
<p>You better visit.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>I can't believe nobody's taken this cookie.</p>
<p>Señor Chang, is there a word in Spanish for someone who used to pretend to be a professor but was a teacher, but wasn't actually a teacher, and is now a student? Is there a word for that? Oh.</p>
<p>If it was in Spanish, you wouldn't know, would you? Bup-bup-bup.</p>
<p>Hit a professor, you'll get expelled.</p>
<p>I will find a loophole.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Then I'll kill you.</p>

<p>Spray tan.</p>
<p>I'd go easy on that punch if I was you.</p>
<p>I've put in a little Hot person, hot people.</p>
<p>The two of them coming this way.</p>
<p>Which one do you want? Hi, Jeff.</p>
<p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Britta, you look great, such a stunning improvement.</p>
<p>Wow, you look gorgeous.</p>
<p>It must've taken all day.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff, you've got a -- oh.</p>
<p>It's right there.</p>
<p>I do? What? Guys, guys, cleanest face ever.</p>
<p>Hey, am I okay? Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, Troy, uh, our study group, after all we've been through, we got to stick together.</p>
<p>You, me, and Jeff and Rain Man, and big boobs and medium boobs and black boobs, we're a family.</p>
<p>What's your point? I've been looking at your situation, and I'd like to make an offer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Am I black boobs? Last call.</p>
<p>Study over.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Just giving things a finale vibe.</p>
<p>Well, how's this for a finale vibe? Pierce asked me to move in with him, in his mansion.</p>
<p>More of a spin-off vibe, but you should do it.</p>
<p>I thought we were friends.</p>
<p>We are.</p>
<p>Best friends, that's why we shouldn't be roommates.</p>
<p>We'll end up fighting and putting a masking tape line down the middle of our room.</p>
<p>We just won't get masking tape.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>You should live with someone who you like but whose friendship wouldn't be altered because of constant irritation, that's Pierce.</p>
<p>If you and I move in, we jump the shark.</p>
<p>That will end it.</p>
<p>Maybe you're ending it.</p>
<p>Oh, and for the record, there was an episode of Happy Days, where a guy literally jumped over a shark, and it was the best one.</p>
<p>I think I'm winning.</p>
<p>Winning tranny queen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, uh, isn't it nice that Jeff and Slater are getting back together? What? Aha.</p>
<p>And psych.</p>
<p>But they will get back together if you don't stop competing with her and start communicating with Jeff.</p>
<p>She already has a head start.</p>
<p>They slept together.</p>
<p>Holy macaroni with pepper jack.</p>
<p>When? Where? During paintball in the study room with Colonel Mustard.</p>
<p>Does it matter? Well, now it does matter.</p>
<p>Where Where in the study room? On the couches.</p>
<p>We use those.</p>
<p>Oh, get over it.</p>
<p>I've seen you shake the dean's hand.</p>
<p>Who knows where he's been? Do you believe in soul mates? Oh.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Um, okay.</p>
<p>Now, don't be mad at me.</p>
<p>I didn't think that more than one person would answer the ad.</p>
<p>Yes, dream coming true.</p>
<p>You guys are leaving already? Yeah.</p>
<p>Got to be in Delaware by tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I'll see you soon.</p>
<p>Have a good summer.</p>
<p>I'll see you in the fall, Annie.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>We're gonna miss you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're the one that didn't even want me in the study group.</p>
<p>Come on, that's not true.</p>
<p>Yeah, none of us did.</p>
<p>I say things others won't.</p>
<p>That has value.</p>
<p>Well, bye.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>Lates.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Good to know you.</p>
<p>Hang 10.</p>
<p>Good evening, Michelle.</p>
<p>Or may I say, Meow-chelle? Who has your car keys? They're in the taco meat.</p>
<p>Now, what say you and I blow this pop stand, and head off for a spot of slap and tickle? I mean sex, in case the lingo hasn't made it to the States.</p>
<p>I think I'm probably leaving here with Jeff.</p>
<p>Really? I'm sorry, I just assumed that you two were done, since, uh, ahem, Jeff and Britta did the the yankee doodle.</p>
<p>Oh, don't tell me that didn't make it to the States.</p>
<p>It clearly originated here.</p>
<p>Okay, we finished tallying all Yo, Goldilocks.</p>
<p>Drop the smirk.</p>
<p>I know about your grungy tumble, and I'm sure it was the highlight of your diary but it was during a pit stop in something real.</p>
<p>You were the pit stop.</p>

<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Good to know you.</p>
<p>Hang 10.</p>
<p>Good evening, Michelle.</p>
<p>Or may I say, Meow-chelle? Who has your car keys? They're in the taco meat.</p>
<p>Now, what say you and I blow this pop stand, and head off for a spot of slap and tickle? I mean sex, in case the lingo hasn't made it to the States.</p>
<p>I think I'm probably leaving here with Jeff.</p>
<p>Really? I'm sorry, I just assumed that you two were done, since, uh, ahem, Jeff and Britta did the the yankee doodle.</p>
<p>Oh, don't tell me that didn't make it to the States.</p>
<p>It clearly originated here.</p>
<p>Okay, we finished tallying all Yo, Goldilocks.</p>
<p>Drop the smirk.</p>
<p>I know about your grungy tumble, and I'm sure it was the highlight of your diary but it was during a pit stop in something real.</p>
<p>You were the pit stop.</p>
<p>He used you to numb the pain of not getting with me.</p>
<p>Jeff needs a girl who doesn't just not wear underwear because Oprah told her it would spice things up, he needs a girl who doesn't wear underwear because she hasn't done laundry in three weeks.</p>
<p>He's been to flavor country now.</p>
<p>They should retire the table we did it on.</p>
<p>Table? Miss Britta Perry.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I have to go.</p>
<p>I just won a contest for being hot.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>This is a huge honor.</p>
<p>This may come as a surprise to you, but I've never actually won anything before.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you still haven't.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm just listing the nominees, so, not a great time to get cocky.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Christine Hollinsworth.</p>
<p>Britney Baker.</p>
<p>Miss Danielle Harman.</p>
<p>Amy Sm--</p>
<p>Jeff Winger, do not get back with Slater.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Psst, psst.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Your lipstick looks better.</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>How's it going? Uh, don't shoot the messenger but everyone at this dance is kind of waiting for your reaction to all this.</p>
<p>Look, I'm trying to think, okay? Yeah, that's cool.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Hey, how's it going? You look great.</p>
<p>Very <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Fatal Attraction</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093010'>Fatal Attraction</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1987&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Uhn.</p>
<p>What's wrong with you? I'm sick.</p>
<p>I don't know why.</p>
<p>Have you considered the 60-inch diameter cookie you're eating? How can something that's delicious make me sick? Unless too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing.</p>
<p>My friendship with Abed is a giant cookie.</p>
<p>I kinda got my own thing going on now.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>First of all, I'm flattered.</p>
<p>Second, have you ever heard of e-mail? You love me? Do you love me? I have something to say.</p>
<p>Jeff, I love you.</p>
<p>I wonder where she got that from.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Do you have a patent on loving people? Would you like a patent in getting your ass kicked? Ack-uh-duh-buh-dee.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Can you stand over there? And can you sit down, please? Jeffrey, choose Britta.</p>
<p>Yeah, Team Britta.</p>
<p>Britta's lame.</p>
<p>Team Slater.</p>
<p>Bring Conan back.</p>
<p>It's been, uh, a great year.</p>
<p>Can't hear you.</p>
<p>No one can hear you.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna sneak right up here and give you this, okay? Uh, hi, it's, uh -- oh, come on, who are you choosing?</p>
<p>I, I don't know.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Come on, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Everybody close their faces.</p>
<p>All right, he's got a lot on his mind.</p>
<p>Leave him alone.</p>
<p>I got it from here.</p>
<p>My name is Professor Ian Duncan, and I would like to rap for you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Drop a beat.</p>
<p>No, no beat.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p># My name is Ian Duncan #</p>
<p># And I'm here to say #</p>
<p># I'm going to rap to the beat #</p>
<p># In a rapping way #</p>
<p># I've got a real big penis #</p>
<p># And I drink lots of tea #</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>You know what, Duncan? That's enough.</p>
<p>You have a problem.</p>
<p>What? Why? Oh.</p>
<p>I have a problem? Yes.</p>
<p>Who is it here who has a Dalmatian fetish? Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, that is an oversimplification, and you are suspended.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You're not a teacher anymore.</p>
<p>What's this? A roll of quarters.</p>
<p>Why? Funny question.</p>
<p>Friends, help me, friends.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>I'll move in with you.</p>
<p>Fantastic, buddy.</p>
<p>Come over on Saturday? My tailor will fit you for a uniform.</p>
<p>Pull him out.</p>
<p>Pull him out.</p>
<p>I thought you left.</p>
<p>I couldn't go.</p>
<p>What happened? I guess as we were driving away, I finally started living in the moment and I realized that, in the moment, Greendale is where I belong.</p>
<p>What are you doing out here? Oh, you know, Britta and Slater told me they loved me.</p>
<p>Really? Yeah.</p>
<p>What did you do? I ran away.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's hard.</p>
<p>Slater makes me feel like I do when I write my New Year's resolutions.</p>
<p>She makes me feel like the guy I want to be.</p>
<p>And Britta makes me feel like the guy I am three weeks after New Year's, when I'm back to hitting my snooze button and screening Mom's phone calls, back to who I really am.</p>
<p>So do you try to evolve or do you try to know what you are? I don't know.</p>
<p>I wish I could live two lives.</p>
<p>One of me would go with Vaughn, and one of me could stay here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One of me be back with Slater, the other could try it with Britta.</p>
<p>And then we could all get together for some weird foursome.</p>
<p>Um, I guess I gotta go deal with it.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Um, I'm glad you're staying.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I'm finally popular enough to be in the yearbook.</p>
<p>What do you mean video yearbook? Where do I sign? Photo not available.</p>
<p>This better not be one of those take-your-top-off videos.</p>
<p>I don't believe in yearbooks.</p>
<p>I just want people to remember there's a guy in between these things.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>What a year.</p>
<p>Only two pregnancy scares.</p>
<p>I give this year a D for delightful.</p>
<p>I can't believe I spent ten bucks on this.</p>
<p>I don't know any of these people.</p>
