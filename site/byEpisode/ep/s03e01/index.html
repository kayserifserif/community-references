<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff? Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Uh, what was the question? What are we gonna do without Pierce in the study group this year? I'm sure we'll figure it out.</p>
<p>Speaking of figuring things out, me and Abed have an announcement.</p>
<p>Troy and I are living together.</p>
<p>Oh, that's--</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>If you want to get us a gift, we're registered at linens 'n things.</p>
<p>We have plenty of linens.</p>
<p>We mainly want the things.</p>
<p>How you like me now, bitches? Dean, you seem different.</p>
<p>Are you in a play right now? Over the summer, I decided it's time to whip this place into shape.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be a mean, lean, deaning machine.</p>
<p>No more paintball, no more spaceships, no more trampolines, and no more-- What is that? It's probably the monkey that lives in the vents.</p>
<p>I named him "Annie's boobs," after Annie's boobs.</p>
<p>See, this is the kind of national lampoonery that is coming to an end this year.</p>
<p>Homie don't dean this.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, let's get to biology on time.</p>
<p>I don't want to be a screwup this year.</p>
<p>Uh, Britta.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>We're really doing this without Pierce? So sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have parted ways with our closest, oldest, craziest, most racist, oldest, elderly, crazy friend, and he's not coming back.</p>
<p>I'm back.</p>
<p>How was your summer? Enlightful, Annie.</p>
<p>I underwent three months of intensive soul-rezoning at the laser lotus celebrity center.</p>
<p>I stand before you a more highly evolved Pierce Hawthorne, one that can accept that this table has a-- has a sort of magic in it.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>And I'd like to come back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Damn it! Oh, uh, sorry.</p>
<p>I just had the frustrating realization that you can't come back to the group, because you're not in biology and it's all filled up.</p>
<p>Well, couldn't we take something else? I mean, surely we've evolved beyond caring what class we take together.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Pierce! I'll do you one better.</p>
<p>I think we've evolved beyond reliance on a group at all.</p>
<p>Aren't we just actual friends now, no matter where we are? You know what's magic about this table? It magically keeps our books from falling on the floor.</p>
<p>The table's for studying, but as friends, we've evolved.</p>
<p>And let's use that first breath of crisp, new, super evolved air to declare proudly and in one voice, "Pierce, we'll see you when we see you."</p>
<p>Don't tell the monkey I'm living here.</p>
<p>Oh, Star-Burns, I see you added a lizard to your special hat and sideburns.</p>
<p>Am I missing anything? Yeah! The human being underneath it all, but no one's really interested in that, are they? No.</p>
<p>I hope we did the right thing about Pierce.</p>
<p>He really seems like he's changed.</p>
<p>What are you, nuts? That's what he wants you to think.</p>
<p>Trust me, we're better off without him.</p>
<p>Excluding Pierce is what drove him crazy last year.</p>
<p>Wrong, being crazy drove him excluded.</p>
<p>What's wrong? Cougar town has been moved to mid-season.</p>
<p>That's never a good sign.</p>
<p>Not cool, not cool, not cool, not cool, not cool-- Hey buddy, hey, it's coming back in January.</p>
<p>Six seasons and a movie.</p>
<p>Six seasons and a movie.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>This is Intro to Biology.</p>
<p>I'm your professor, Dr. Marshall King, PhD.</p>
<p>It took me 6,205 hours to get my degree, and I know, because I was only allowed in the library one hour per day at the San Vicente correctional facility while serving a sentence of 25 to life.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about that word.</p>
<p>"Life." </p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's a new phone.</p>
<p>Switching to vibrate.</p>
<p>Continue.</p>
<p>This is really great.</p>
<p>I stared at a crack in the ground in my cell for years, and one day, something grew from it.</p>
<p>A single blade of grass.</p>
<p>Vibrates louder than the ringer.</p>
<p>Gosh.</p>
<p>You know what? Turning it off.</p>
<p>Living thing, growing from dead stone.</p>
<p>Get out! - Oh, it's off, it's off.</p>
<p>Out! I turned it off.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>And don't bother coming back.</p>
<p>Seriously?

<p>I've seen Milk.</p>
<p>Now get out.</p>
<p>Dude, learn to blend.</p>
<p>I will not tolerate monkeys living on campus.</p>
<p>If I wanted to run a monkey hotel, I'd install a banana buffet.</p>
<p>I'd use vines as elevators, and I'd put tail holes in the bathrobes, and I'd lower all the shower knobs.</p>
<p>Wow, you've really thought this through.</p>
<p>And now it's your turn.</p>
<p>Brainstorm.</p>
<p>Idea shower.</p>
<p>Spray your solutions all over me.</p>
<p>Well, w-we could seal all the vents and then pump the ducts with some kind of gas that knocks out monkeys.</p>
<p>Monkey knockout gas! Now that's the kind of grounded, sensible thinking I want to see this year.</p>
<p>Catherine, who's next? Vice Dean Laybourne, from the air conditioning repair school annex.</p>
<p>Vice Dean.</p>
<p>Dean.</p>
<p>New suit, Dean? New Dean, vice Dean.</p>
<p>New Dean.</p>
<p>I see that you used school funds to buy an espresso machine for your faculty break room.</p>
<p>I don't recall being consulted on that.</p>
<p>I don't consult you on anything.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>The air-conditioning repair school annex seems to think.</p>
<p>That it's separate from Greendale, but it's an annex.</p>
<p>An appendage, on a body, with a head, and this head is saying to this appendage, "whazup?" What you say makes sense, Dean.</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>You bring your head down to my appendage tomorrow, and I'll show you "whazup." </p>
<p>I'll be there.</p>
<p>I think I found something that will help Abed! Abed, did you know that Cougar Town is an American adaptation of a 1990s British sitcom? Cougarton abbey.</p>
<p>Just been 'round Cougarton chapel.</p>
<p>I may be having an awakening.</p>
<p>Come off it, Deidre.</p>
<p>You've only been having a butchers at the choir boys.</p>
<p>Better than nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks, Britta.</p>
<p>Can you believe that guy, kicking me out of class like that? It's gonna be impossible to find a science class with six open spots.</p>
<p>Why would we need to do that? Because I'm not in biology anymore.</p>
<p>And neither is Pierce, but you're both still our friends.</p>
<p>We've evolved.</p>
<p>Right, Jeff? Yes, we have.</p>
<p>And we all love each other.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And we all go to the same school, so, uh, I guess I'll see ya when I see ya.</p>
<p>Hey, guess what.</p>
<p>I was on the wait list for biology, somebody got kicked out, I am-- Here to study! Yay! All hail, sir eats alone.</p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard.</p>
<p>I heard about your prescription socks.</p>
<p>Hope you don't mind, Jeff, but I've got a new favorite show, and I'm only on episode six.</p>
<p>You guys got about five minutes left to eat.</p>
<p>Oh, my, time flies when you're studying the science of life.</p>
<p>Well, I think time flies when you're joking around about movie titles that sound like names for poops.</p>
<p>Remains of the day.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>Were you eavesdropping on our study session? I was eavesdropping on your goof-off session, and you dummies missed the most obvious one.</p>
<p>No, I said, "Green Mile." </p>
<p>Operation dumbo drop! - Ew! - Gross! Too clever by half, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>All right, well uh, I gotta go.</p>
<p>Thanks for the five minutes.</p>
<p>Aw, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Blimey.</p>
<p>The barrister's foreclosed the abbey.</p>
<p>Fancy a drink, then? Oi, fetch us a hemlock.</p>
<p>Um - Um-- - Britta? Why did everyone on Cougarton Abbey just die? They only ran six episodes.</p>
<p>That's the great thing about British tv.</p>
<p>They give you closure.</p>
<p>No, no, no! We'll find you a new favorite show! We'll find you a new favorite show! Come on, buddy.</p>
<p>You are human tennis elbow.</p>
<p>You are a pizza burn on the roof of the world's mouth.</p>
<p>You are the opposite of Batman.</p>
<p>You don't need them, man.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I'll see 'em when I see 'em.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You and I, we should hang out some time, huh? Grab a drink? Sure.</p>
<p>Where are you living now? The air vents.</p>
<p>I live in the air vents of the school.</p>
<p>Shhhh! I'm free, Jeff.</p>
<p>Free! I gotta get back in that class.</p>
<p>Real Dean coming through-- Oh, my goodness spacious, vice dean Is this where Greendale's money is going? More accurately, Dean, it's where Greendale's money comes from.</p>
<p>Our air-conditioning program has a job placement rate five times higher than the rest of your school combined.</p>
<p>Our alumnini donations comprise 80% of your entire school's budget.</p>
<p>And you want to know why we think we deserve an espresso machine?! Well, I guess I didn't know.</p>
<p>I-- And you never had to, Dean.</p>
<p>You could have lived the rest of your life in blissful ignorance and died a happy, pansexual imp.</p>
<p>But you wanted to feel power this year.</p>
<p>Well, now, you're going to feel my power as it surges downward from me, straight through you, from nostril to rectum, now until the end of time.</p>
<p>And that's "whazup." </p>
<p>I forgot everything you said before "rectum"! Who are these guys? This is my legal team because I think it's time we worked out a new agreement.</p>
<p>He doesn't look like a lawyer.</p>
<p>That's a barber.</p>
<p>Because I'm also sick of that ridiculous goatee.</p>
<p>You look like a white Lou Gossett, Jr.</p>
<p>You deserve a bigger office.</p>
<p>Biggest office I ever had.</p>
<p>I'm here to apologize, Dr. King, and beg you for a seat in biology.</p>
<p>I tell you what, 'N Sync, you wanna learn about life? Give up the phone.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You're asking me for a bribe? I can't be bought, man.</p>
<p>You feel me? See, prison was my walls.</p>
<p>But you put your walls up.</p>
<p>You, and your phone, and your attitude, and your fruit loops cologne.</p>
<p>Your walls put up so tight, man, not even a blade of grass could get through.</p>
<p>But even if it did, you wouldn't appreciate it.</p>
<p>That's why you can't come back to my class.</p>
<p>What's your problem with me, man? And don't act like it's not about me specifically because you've been in-- Busted! Hey! Take it easy, Winger.</p>
<p>Everything okay? It is now that I have this.</p>
<p>This is my ticket to getting back in the group.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! I want to be in the group so bad! All right, let's smoke 'em and choke 'em.</p>
<p>No! No! N-n-n-- Uh-oh! What is that? Monkey gas! Monkey gas? Oh, my g-- Abed? All your friends are here.</p>
<p>They wanna talk to you.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>How is this different from the way he always is? I don't want to push it, but this would be a great time to baptize him.</p>
<p>Abed, maybe this can be your new favorite show.</p>
<p>It's a British Sci-Fi series that's been on the air since 1962.</p>
<p>Britta, you've done enough, okay? Why don't you go start a ruiners' club? Oh wait, you'd probably just ruin it.</p>
<p>Well then, I'd be doing a good job because it's a ruiners' club.</p>
<p>You ruined my analogy.</p>
<p>Guys, look! Blimey, inspector! Where have we wound up this time? The question isn't where, constable, but when.</p>
<p>Inspector, look out! Blorgons! Eradicate! Eradicate! This is the best show I've ever seen in my entire life.</p>
<p>Having fun without me again? Jeff, what happened? You look 70.</p>
<p>Abed has a new favorite tv show, Jeff.</p>
<p>It's called Inspector Spacetime-- Can it, boobs.</p>
<p>I came here to let you know that your best friend Pierce is the one that got me kicked out of bio class and the study group.</p>
<p>It was a plan he hatched from the beginning with his pal, Professor Kane.</p>
<p>But, Jeff, that's a photo I gave our professor of me visiting Hawthorne Wipes' spokesman and rap artist Sugar Cube in prison during the '90s.</p>
<p>Well, th-th-they look alike.</p>
<p>Uh, I guess they share one important feature in your eyes.</p>
<p>Well, that's not fair! Look, I-I-I-I was standing far away, and I saw the prison uniform! Oh, Jeffrey! Oh, come on, obviously I don't mean all black people are in prison! Oh! Jeff, clearly you have gone off the deep end.</p>
<p>Don't blame him.</p>
<p>The table is powerful, and being cut off from it-- Shut the-- I've become Agitated.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>We'll continue this discourse at a later date.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>He just needs some space.</p>
<p>I'm going to kill the one thing you love! I'm gonna kill it! As long as it breathes, it controls our lives! I just came by to tell everyone this year isn't gonna be that different.</p>
<p>With the notable exception, we really won't have any money.</p>
<p>Have a nice night.</p>
<p>What is with that guy? Did you find the monkey? No, but here's the invoice for the gassing.</p>
<p>Okay, as it turns out, I cannot pay this Or your salaries starting on Two weeks ago.</p>
<p>But, what I do have are these vouchers for the classes of your choosing.</p>
<p>You're lucky I need my scuba certification.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I'm the one living in your vents.</p>
<p>I have no home and no job.</p>
<p>Does that mean you'll work for room and board? Okay, I was lying the whole time.</p>
<p>I didn't want the group to evolve.</p>
<p>I just didn't want Pierce around.</p>
<p>I hate him.</p>
<p>Okay, but, Jeff, what you did-- it's hard to get past that.</p>
<p>I know you're already out of the study group, but I'm gonna have to ask that you stop being my friend.</p>
<p>Okay, look, everybody, here's the thing, I am not as evolved as I said I was.</p>
<p>The biology class was full, so I told Professor Kane I'd pay him a few thousand dollars to K-kick Jeff out.</p>
<p>What?! Pierce! What? I can't believe Jeff attacked a table with a fire axe and still only managed to be the second craziest man in the room.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody in favor of voting Pierce out of the group? Stop! Stop! Pierce isn't crazy.</p>
<p>The table IsMagic.</p>
<p>As someone who's been on the other side, I can tell you, it is a scary, lonely, Chang-filled world out there, and sure, this group has sprouted some legs, but why are we in such a rush to leave the tide pool, when the only things waiting for us on shore are the sands of time.</p>
<p>And the hungry seagulls of slowly growing apart.</p>
<p>Man, I really need this biology class.</p>
<p>Pierce! Professor Kane has never taken a bribe from anyone in his life.</p>
<p>You feel me? Yeah, I lied, but you seem to have a harder time being the bad guy than me.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I do Which, in a weird way, makes me a pretty bad guy.</p>
<p>We're one and the same.</p>
<p>Please don't.</p>
<p>Jeff, but you're still kicked out of biology.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm not worried about it.</p>
<p>Life has a way of breaking through.</p>
<p>So, uh, here's what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>I'm a drug dealer, right? And you're a scientist, so couldn't we get, like, a Brea<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Breaking Bad</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747'>Breaking Bad</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>2008&ndash;2013</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>e of thing going? Sorry, star-face, you just lost your seat in my class.</p>
<p>There, now the table is good as new.</p>
<p>And so is Abed.</p>
<p>Britta, I'm sorry I was overprotective about it.</p>
<p>I'll try and be more supportive of you.</p>
<p>Well, here's your first chance.</p>
<p>Helping Abed has inspired me to finally declare a major.</p>
<p>I'm gonna study Psychology.</p>
<p>Like in a research capacity? No, in a hands-on capacity.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be a therapist.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, keep it down.</p>
<p>There's a new sheriff in town.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So this is the year we all die.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
