<p>I booked a sketch artist, an improv troupe, and a laser projecting a burning pelvis onto the ceiling.</p>
<p>A laser? Well, this isn't gonna be your mother's sexually transmitted disease awareness fair.</p>
<p>You've been quite the little helper, Annie.</p>
<p>STD fair, guys.</p>
<p>Catch knowledge.</p>
<p>You think you're better than me? No.</p>
<p>You stick to quoting movie lines, I'll stick to sports.</p>
<p>Trying to reduce my referencing.</p>
<p>Well, you're not moving into sports.</p>
<p>You and I are playing real basketball, right now.</p>
<p>Sounds fun.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't.</p>
<p>And it won't be.</p>
<p>Catch knowledge.</p>
<p>Sorry, not interested in ignoring your very important cause.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Oh, Sabrina is my new secretary.</p>
<p>Secretary is a little degrading to women.</p>
<p>I help the dean do office-y things.</p>
<p>Oh, gender saved.</p>
<p>My casual friend and I are gonna have a non-romantic breakfast if you'd like to join us.</p>
<p>Cafeteria's closed.</p>
<p>Fortune cookie? Isn't it great? Greendale is the latest campus to catch a case of public-health fever.</p>
<p>You know the toilets in the women's bathrooms don't have seats, right? Because they keep getting stolen.</p>
<p>Sabrina, take a note.</p>
<p>I want hidden cameras in every stall.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>"You will get AIDS." </p>
<p>Flip it over.</p>
<p>"Unless you go to the STD fair." </p>
<p>I wrote that.</p>
<p>Congratu-horrible.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Catch knowledge.</p>
<p>Jeff, you and I are friends, right? Okay.</p>
<p>You may have noticed a recent change in my demeanor.</p>
<p>I haven't.</p>
<p>Well, I have a new girlfriend.</p>
<p>She is super-smart, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>I always know what you mean.</p>
<p>Can't wait for you to meet her.</p>
<p>You know, when you catch a big fish, you wanna stuff her and put her on the mantle.</p>
<p>How about tonight? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Troy and I played basketball.</p>
<p>It's fun.</p>
<p>Don't gloat.</p>
<p>It's impossible to guard you.</p>
<p>Your eyes are too gentle and mysterious.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, Jeff and I are double-dating tonight with my new girlfriend.</p>
<p>Ooh! You got that from "I doubt it"? Pierce has got a girlfriend.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>What does she do? She's an escort.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Some mysteries solve themselves.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that's just her profession.</p>
<p>She doesn't escort me.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I met her in my Marketing class.</p>
<p>And I'm taking Doreen to Annie's mixer tonight.</p>
<p>You mean the STD fair.</p>
<p>Catch knowledge.</p>
<p>Taking a call girl to an STD fair? There's a joke here.</p>
<p>So, Jeff, dust off that black book and rustle up a honey, huh? Is there a pill that makes the word "no" clearer? Well, it is pretty short notice.</p>
<p>Probably couldn't get a date anyway.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're right.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Maybe it has something to do with crabs.</p>
<p>They're like a food but also a disease? I wonder, Jeff, for all your feather flashing, when was the last time you actually scored? I don't know the precise date, Pierce, because I'm not you.</p>
<p>So there's no receipt.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Ehh.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Shouldn't take pot shots at some woman because you can't get a date.</p>
<p>I can get dates any time I want.</p>
<p>What is this, some kind of joke? No, this is.</p>
<p>"Don't eat the crab dip." </p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ahh! You hear that, Annie? That's the sound of STDs screaming, "No, stop being so aware of us." </p>
<p>And it's all thanks to you.</p>
<p>I was voted "most likely to succeed" at my rehab clinic.</p>
<p>Well, in recognition of all your hard work, I have decided that you should conduct the condom demonstration.</p>
<p>You're gonna be center stage showing everyone how to put a condom on a, uh, well, what my dad called a Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>Um, I don't know if I'm the right person.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Not a real one.</p>
<p>No, it's an anatomically correct model, you know.</p>
<p>But trust me, eyes closed, you can't tell the difference.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, it's Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to see what you were doing tonight.</p>
<p>Do I know your name? What kind of question is that? Of course I know.</p>
<p>Well, if I answer now, you'll never learn a valuable lesson about trust, Jennifer.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Pierce really got to you, huh? It has been a dry spell.</p>
<p>But it's been a while since I've tried.</p>
<p>So I'm trying.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see that.</p>
<p>This is a lot of outgoing calls.</p>
<p>"Car Wash Redhead." </p>
<p>"Tube Top R.E.M. Concert." </p>
<p>"Juror Number 6." </p>
<p>That sounds above board.</p>
<p>At least you have "Mommy" in here.</p>
<p>That's not my mom.</p>
<p>Dude, not cool.</p>
<p>You saying "dude" is not cool.</p>
<p>What are you doing? "Hot Blonde Spanish Class"? You're welcome.</p>
<p>This is the phone book of a man in his 20s.</p>
<p>The women literally have no identities.</p>
<p>It's pretty shallow.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go study with Shirley.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be here, rethinking my way of life.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Call "Mommy." </p>
<p>Guys, I have a problem.</p>
<p>The dean wants me to demonstrate proper use of a condom at the stupid fair, by putting one on a mannequin's stupid thingamabob.</p>
<p>It's a big honor but I'm gonna screw it up.</p>
<p>Well, it's easy enough to practice.</p>
<p>Britta, do you have a banana? This is an anatomically correct model I'll be handling.</p>
<p>Real whatchamacallits are nothing like bananas.</p>
<p>Are they? Have you never seen one? Shh! Annie, being a virgin in this day and age is something to be proud of.</p>
<p>You're like a unicorn.</p>
<p>I'm not a unicorn.</p>
<p>I had relations with my high school boyfriend.</p>
<p>We did it to <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Madonna</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000187'>Madonna</a></span><span class='years'>1958&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>music_department</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156841'>tt0156841</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116250'>tt0116250</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099422'>tt0099422</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460'>tt0246460</a></span></span></span></span>'s Erotica on the floor of his walk-in closet.</p>
<p>But he wouldn't let me look at it.</p>
<p>He cried after and during.</p>
<p>He's gay now.</p>
<p>I think he was gay then.</p>
<p>So you never seen one when you were growing up? Like, you know, on the Internet, in a picture, or <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Harvey Keitel</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000172'>Harvey Keitel</a></span><span class='years'>1939&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103759'>tt0103759</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388'>tt2278388</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912'>tt0110912</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236'>tt0105236</a></span></span></span></span>'s? I've caught glimpses but I've never got a real good look at one.</p>
<p>What I need to do is practice on the actual model.</p>
<p>But the dean has it locked in his office.</p>
<p>Okay, that's easy.</p>
<p>We'll go to him, ask him if we --</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is really embarrassing.</p>
<p>I don't want anyone to know.</p>
<p>I just wanna figure out how to do it and get it over with.</p>
<p>The dean is counting on me, and I want him to know that I'm someone he can trust.</p>
<p>We have to break into his office.</p>
<p>I actually have no problem with that.</p>
<p>I think I could do that.</p>
<p>Oh, hello, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Hi, Pierce.</p>
<p>I was just going into the fair to wait for my smoking-hot date.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>How about you? Were you ever able to, you know, come up with a date? No, no, because I didn't try, because taking a date to an STD fair would be lame.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, kid.</p>
<p>You're going through a dry spell.</p>
<p>From my experience, they don't last any more than 12, 13 years.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>No gonorrhea, please, please, please.</p>
<p>No gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Ow! It burns.</p>
<p>Oh! That's gonna hurt.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>Dean, your assistant, is she single? What are her likes and dislikes? Yes, on single.</p>
<p>She likes hip-hop and horses.</p>
<p>Dislikes beards and --</p>
<p>Yeah, I was done talking.</p>
<p>Is it me or are horses the most beautiful creatures? They're so majestic.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Just this morning, when I was shaving and listening to the new <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Jay-Z</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419650'>Jay-Z</a></span><span class='years'>1969&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120812'>tt0120812</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1599348'>tt1599348</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092'>tt1343092</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1583421'>tt1583421</a></span></span></span></span>, I was thinking how I wanna squeeze in a gallop this weekend.</p>
<p>Do you own a horse? Can you ever really own a horse? Pierce.</p>
<p>Yeah? This is Sabrina.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds after you walked away, I asked her to be my date and she said yes.</p>
<p>You must have a great personality.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Jeff, you proved me wrong.</p>
<p>You got a girl.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>This is Doreen.</p>
<p>Ready for our double-date? Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Wait, how'd you do that? Is this the best safe-sex fair or what? Ha-ha-ha! Check out these condoms.</p>
<p>All along the side it says, "Greendale." </p>
<p>Exclamation point, my idea.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Me, in a dune buggy, with syphilis.</p>
<p>This is going on the fridge.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Look how gorgeous Doreen is tonight.</p>
<p>Hey, can we? Let's lay out our plans for the evening.</p>
<p>You wingman me, I wingman you.</p>
<p>Maybe we split up for a little hoo-ha and then meet in the morning for eggs and details.</p>
<p>That sounds like the worst combination plate ever.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Argh! I can't believe you beat me again.</p>
<p>Do you want my stuffed animal? Gah! We're arm wrestling.</p>

<p>I don't know the rules.</p>
<p>Don't I need a semi-truck and a son? The rules are, "You suck." </p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Uh, I wanna wait for a more inspiring song.</p>
<p>This score isn't right.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You broke my hand, you bastard.</p>
<p>I can't do anything with this.</p>
<p>No, let me see that.</p>
<p>Oh, I can see through the door.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, there she blows.</p>
<p>I wanna see, I wanna see.</p>
<p>Shh! Okay, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I'm the one that needs to see.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Oh, I had it wrong.</p>
<p>Is that considered large? Oh, no.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What in the reverse Porky's is going on here? You know, Doreen speaks six languages.</p>
<p>You should hear her order wine in French.</p>
<p>Hey, honey, say, "cabernet sauvigonenon." </p>
<p>Pierce, you're embarrassing me.</p>
<p>You know a lot about wine? Well, I did have a client who owned a vineyard in Napa.</p>
<p>He was into S&M and merlot so we called it S&M&M.</p>
<p>Honey, you're boring the crap out of Jeff.</p>
<p>Be right back.</p>
<p>I have to make tinkles.</p>
<p>Well then, I'm gonna go get us another round.</p>
<p>You know, you are not what I expected.</p>
<p>You're smart, you're classy, you're not wearing go-go boots.</p>
<p>They're in the shop.</p>
<p>You know, despite what people think, I actually spend most of my time talking.</p>
<p>As men get older, they wanna spend time with someone they can have a real conversation with.</p>
<p>That is going to suck.</p>

Come on, Sabrina's cute, but she thinks that <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Monty Python</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063929'>Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1969&ndash;1974</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span> is the evil snake from <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Harry Potter</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527'>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>2001&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span><span class='tag genre'>Family</span><span class='tag genre'>Fantasy</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Trust me, I know girls I can converse with who are way more annoying.</p>
<p>I will take "tinkles" over "we need to talk" every time.</p>
<p>Hey, babe.</p>
<p>Ready to show me that Lexus? I thought you'd never ask.</p>
<p>Doreen, it was very nice to meet you.</p>
<p>You can do better.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Oh, they already left? What a couple of nincompoops.</p>
<p>Before I buy dinner, I have to ask.</p>
<p>Is there any lovemaking on the table? We're through, Pierce.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go to the bar and you can join me if you'd like.</p>
<p>And we can still have a lovely evening, but it will cost you 200 bucks.</p>
<p>That is a pretty big discount.</p>
<p>I had no idea alcohol would make people horny.</p>
<p>It makes me sleepy.</p>
<p>I don't Dean? Yeah.</p>
<p>We have a 597 currently going on in your office.</p>
<p>in my office? No.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around and we're gonna cover him up.</p>
<p>Okay, ladies, I am shocked at the reverse Porky's that has happened here.</p>
<p>I don't see what the big deal is.</p>
<p>Annie needed to look at the model of the pen Okay, the P-word has entered into play.</p>
<p>That's exactly why I wanted Gayle, our school counselor here, and Monique, who's keeping record, to ensure we discuss these sensitive topics in a legally appropriate manner.</p>
<p>I think everyone should say "penis" so we can take away the negative power of the word, yeah? So everybody.</p>
<p>Penis.</p>
<p>She didn't say it.</p>
<p>Now why did you break in to see the penis? Wow, I really do feel more comfortable saying that now, Gayle.</p>
<p>I just wanna focus on the girl who won't say "penis." </p>
<p>This is a judgment-free zone, so express yourself.</p>
<p>You know what? I don't want to express myself.</p>
<p>I don't wanna sit in a room full of people and say the P-word.</p>
<p>I like being repressed.</p>
<p>I am totally comfortable being uncomfortable with my sexuality.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, if everyone were a little more like me, we wouldn't have to have an STD fair.</p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>That's my pumpkin.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>By the way, now that I've gotten a good look at one, I don't see what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>A giant thumb in a turtleneck.</p>
<p>Whoop-dee-doo! You have a really awesome body.</p>
<p>You probably hear that all the time.</p>
<p>Not as much as I should.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Professor.</p>
<p>What? I'm not a professor.</p>
<p>But you're at Greendale and you're old.</p>
<p>I'm a student.</p>
<p>Yikers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's pretty much yikers for me too.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I can make an exception, professor.</p>
<p>You know, I can't do this.</p>
<p>What? But this is your car.</p>
<p>Keep it.</p>
<p>But, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>How do you like those apples? I don't like those apples.</p>
<p>I'm so upset.</p>
<p>It was just a fluke I won those other games.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Wow, this may be the only STD fair to actually spread STDs.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Shut up, Ben.</p>
<p>Condom water balloon fight! What the hell? Dude, these are leaking.</p>
<p>Ho-ho-ho! Oh, my God.</p>
<p>That's why you don't print things on condoms.</p>
<p>Everyone's getting preggers and it's all your fault.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Troy, all the condoms are faulty.</p>
<p>As the best athlete on campus, I need you to run to my office and make an announcement before everyone leaves.</p>
<p>Dean, I am not the best athlete on campus.</p>
<p>Abed is.</p>
<p>I know you let me win the race.</p>
<p>But you didn't say anything.</p>
<p>That's because I wanted it to be true.</p>
<p>You're a really good friend.</p>
<p>No, Abed.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>For the love of God, run.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Go, Abed, go.</p>
<p>Before people sex one another.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Back already.</p>
<p>Detail time? I stopped.</p>
<p>I don't know what's wrong with me.</p>
<p>I mean, she's hot.</p>
<p>I think this place is sapping my life force.</p>
<p>Oh, it's not Greendale, Jeff, it's you.</p>
<p>You're becoming more mature.</p>
<p>A man reaches a point in his life where he stops looking for a place to hang his underwear and starts looking for a place to hang his hat.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I was waiting for that to become inappropriate or racist.</p>
<p>What happened to Doreen? Oh, uh, she said if I wanted to continue, I would have to pay.</p>
<p>Oh, man, that is rough.</p>
<p>No, it was a wake-up call.</p>
<p>Doreen is a very special lady.</p>
<p>I did not treat her right.</p>
<p>I have stuff to work on, you know? You'll get there.</p>
<p>We're both gonna get there.</p>
<p>Here's to being better men.</p>
