<p>I think I'm failing Psychopharmacology.</p>
<p>Why are you taking that? I thought it was a class about crazy farm animals, okay? Let's finish the unit.</p>
<p>I don't wanna be late for lunch.</p>
<p>Amar is to love, right? Oh, speaking of love, Shirley, how's it going with the sexy dreadlock guy? Oh, I'm sure I don't have a chance with him.</p>
<p>Abed and I talked to him by the vending machine.</p>
<p>He asked about you.</p>
<p>He specifically asked about me? When Annie brought you up, he specifically asked, "Who is that?" Abed.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What? That's what he said.</p>
<p>Abed, your social skills aren't exactly streets ahead.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I don't.</p>
<p>You're not alone in this case.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Stop trying to coin the phrase, "Streets ahead." </p>
<p>Trying? Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Coined and minted.</p>
<p>Been there, coined that.</p>
<p>"Streets ahead" is verbal wildfire.</p>
<p>Does it just mean cool, or is it supposed to be like miles ahead? If you have to ask, you're streets behind.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We can banter if we wanna banter.</p>
<p>But I'm leaving for lunch early.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Me three.</p>
<p>Streets ahead.</p>
<p>Man, you guys really love these stupid chicken fingers, huh? They're not stupid, they're the only good thing in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>I haven't had one in weeks.</p>
<p>They run out so fast.</p>
<p>If God were edible, not that I'm Catholic, but if it was cool to eat God, he'd be a chicken finger.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn't know.</p>
<p>I'm a vegetarian.</p>
<p>Oh, shocker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you guys knew how they treated the animals that you're eating, you'd eat them even faster just to put them out of their misery.</p>
<p>And then you would throw up.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe I'm feeling extra protective of animals today because my cat is sick.</p>
<p>Oh, a cat? That's awful.</p>
<p>He has diabetes.</p>
<p>He can't even make it to the litter box.</p>
<p>Chicken run.</p>
<p>Whoo! I'm afraid that I'm gonna have to put her to sleep and --</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Aw, go on.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>
<p>Save some for me.</p>
<p>Watch out.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I can hear those fingers calling my name.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Troy, Troy.</p>
<p>Did you get my text message? Did you get my text message? I think it's Hi.</p>
<p>I gotta stop hanging out with her.</p>
<p>She sounds like a chicken finger.</p>
<p>Again? Outrageous.</p>
<p>At least apologize.</p>
<p>How can you just stand there like a mute idiot? Ooh.</p>
<p>Well, throat surgery might humanize you.</p>
<p>But it doesn't make this acceptable.</p>
<p>So cute.</p>
<p>And I don't even normally like dreadlocks.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>His dreadlocks remind me of the Predator.</p>
<p>Which is weird because you're doing the actual hunting, and you seem invisible to him.</p>
<p>Abed, you know what I do? Before I talk, I ask myself: "What am I about to say? And how might it affect each person listening?" I'm really glad you said that, Britta.</p>
<p>The idea that you compulsively filter yourself makes your lack of flavor kind of a flavor.</p>
<p>Sorry, guys, they ran out again.</p>
<p>Something's gotta be done.</p>
<p>Oh, I love chicken fingers.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, you're the man.</p>
<p>What the hell, man? That's half our problem right there.</p>
<p>Star-Burns works the fryer and skims fingers.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>He gives them to people just so they'll act like he isn't Star-Burns.</p>
<p>Well, I may not eat meat, but I am not gonna eat that injustice.</p>
<p>Let's complain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If we complain, he gets a warning and learns to be sneakier.</p>
<p>I say we knock him out of the kitchen and replace him with one of our own all in one move.</p>
<p>Then we're the ones with the chicken.</p>
<p>It's like a mafia movie.</p>
<p>As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in a mafia movie.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>That's exactly what it's like, Abed.</p>
<p>And you get the most important job.</p>
<p>You're gonna be fry cook.</p>
<p>We may be watching different mafia movies.</p>
<p>You worked in your dad's restaurant, right? Well, you'll apply for the job after we get Star-Burns fired.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know about the firing.</p>
<p>I think he really relies on that income.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Every day you flock here like sheep and wait in line for a broken promise from a dirty system.</p>
<p>Back in those days, Jeff Winger was the guy that made things happen.</p>
<p>He always knew what to say, and he always knew when to slap the table.</p>
<p>You wanna be sheep, keep flocking.</p>
<p>You wanna be wolves, form a pack.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>It was that simple.</p>
<p>At that moment, we stopped being a family and started being a family in italics.</p>
<p>Britta got cozy with Star-Burns.</p>
<p>Can I touch both of? Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He lowered his guard.</p>
<p>He was gone.</p>
<p>I mean, the way Jeff saw it, by not respecting us, Star-Burns had basically brought it on himself.</p>
<p>And when his job opened up, we did what we had to do to keep the list of applicants to a minimum.</p>
<p>I had worked in my dad's falafel restaurant , so I had a pretty impressive resume.</p>
<p>It's very impressive.</p>
<p>Especially your reference.</p>
<p>Just give them a call right now.</p>
<p>But we weren't taking any chances.</p>
<p>The fix was in.</p>
<p>Trump Tower, this is <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Donald</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874339'>Donald Trump</a></span><span class='years'>1946&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313737'>tt0313737</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104431'>tt0104431</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782'>tt0364782</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099656'>tt0099656</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Well, he can deep-fry the hell out of chicken I can tell you that.</p>
<p>Troy even applied for the same job and gave the world's worst interview.</p>
<p>Just to make me look better, and that was that.</p>
<p>This was the glorious time.</p>
<p>No more racing to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>No more lines.</p>
<p>To us, lines were for suckers, hacks, sheep.</p>
<p>We were wolves.</p>
<p>And we had the chicken to prove it.</p>
<p>To victory.</p>
<p>It feels unfamiliar, but it tastes like chicken.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>You guys are lucky.</p>
<p>They're always running out.</p>
<p>Would you like one? The name's Shirley, memorize it.</p>
<p>I will, Shirley.</p>
<p>See that, ladies? The universe goes by supply and demand.</p>
<p>The more you take and use, the more it sends.</p>
<p>Somebody's been taking a little extra.</p>
<p>What's in that container? Eight fingers.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed's study group.</p>
<p>Why you giving Chang chicken? We have an agreement.</p>
<p>If you get caught skimming, you get fired.</p>
<p>We all go back to eating like Britta.</p>
<p>Yeah, we put you in that job.</p>
<p>I dressed like a crazy pharaoh for you, man.</p>
<p>You make the fingers, Abed, not the decisions.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It's okay, buddy.</p>
<p>But just remember, these things have power.</p>
<p>So just let me know next time you have any more agreements, all right? Yeah, I agreed to give Chang eight fingers per lunch in exchange for a 10 percent bump on every Spanish test for each of us.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed makes the fingers and the decisions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm gonna pass Spanish class.</p>
<p>Oh, Abed, you're the best.</p>
<p>At Greendale, they were always out of chicken fingers.</p>
<p>So whoever could get them had power.</p>
<p>And I the guy was in the apron, so I came up with a system.</p>
<p>And pretty soon half the chicken at Greendale was going out the side door.</p>
<p>Everybody in our crew had a job.</p>
<p>T-Bone was the bag man.</p>
<p>He'd move the fingers to a storeroom where two of the girls did the packaging.</p>
<p>We could trust them not to eat the supply because Britta was a vegetarian.</p>
<p>And Shirley figured that if she stole, she'd go to hell.</p>
<p>They'd hand the stuff out the window to Annie.</p>
<p>She was the leg man, the distributor.</p>
<p>The crazy thing was, it was their food.</p>
<p>And we were stealing it and giving it back to them like it was a big favor.</p>
<p>Nobody asked any questions, because Pierce's experience as a CEO had taught him how to keep the wheels from squeaking.</p>
<p>I had it all worked out on a schedule.</p>
<p>You know, I've never been fired.</p>
<p>The minute before you thought about busting us, that was the minute you had chicken in your hand.</p>
<p>It's just insulting that you're eating his chicken fingers in front of me.</p>
<p>Everyone had their hand out.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted what we had.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, here you go.</p>
<p>And Jeff had the most important job of all.</p>
<p>He was at the top.</p>
<p>He was the boss.</p>
<p>He was our leader.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on? AV kids hooked it up.</p>
<p>Abed supplied the whole department with chicken fingers.</p>
<p>You think that's good, check out my posse and Troy's monkey.</p>
<p>Troy, why do you have a monkey? It's an animal that looks like a dude.</p>
<p>Why don't I have 10 of them? Guys, look at what Abed scored for me.</p>
<p>It has a million zippers, and it was free.</p>
<p>Oh, robot.</p>
<p>I am a robot.</p>
<p>I am programmed to love this backpack.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>More insane than programming them to replace auto workers? What? Okay, okay, if you're not in this study group, please --</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That means you, sexy dreadlocks.</p>
<p>Britta's hairdresser.</p>
<p>What? Pierce's hackneyed entourage.</p>
<p>Hackneyed? You see the turban guy? Yes, in a '90s ski movie that featured an entourage.</p>
<p>Don't you guys think this is getting out of hand? We're not gonna get caught.</p>
<p>We have campus security on the take.</p>
<p>Abed's got it all figured out.</p>
<p>Well, that's a relief.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool being friends with the biggest man on campus.</p>
<p>Isn't that right, Annie's Boobs? Please rename that thing.</p>
<p>And this time, not with a contest on Twitter.</p>
<p>It's his Twitter account.</p>
<p>He can do what he wants.</p>
<p>They are my body parts.</p>
<p>Know what I don't appreciate? I do not consent to this.</p>
<p>You'll be begging for his company.</p>
<p>I own that.</p>
<p>I wouldn't threaten a monkey.</p>
<p>They have more lactic acid than us.</p>
<p>Shared my chicken with him.</p>
<p>Talk to the backpack.</p>
<p>You're the worst, Annie.</p>
<p>Streets ahead.</p>
<p>Now, where's he going? Line starts behind you.</p>
<p>Oh, he's cool.</p>
<p>Six fingers every Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>And what can you offer? I have a bicycle.</p>
<p>And I teach beginner's tennis.</p>
<p>Cool, okay.</p>
<p>Six fingers Wednesdays, all right.</p>
<p>We'll be in touch, Janel.</p>
<p>Thank you, Abed.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>It's quite a setup you got here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it.</p>
<p>It turns out everyone has needs and everyone has functions.</p>
<p>Look, I've been thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to hit the big red button and bring an end to this operation.</p>
<p>I mean, it's been fun, but it's out of control now.</p>
<p>Am I right? I don't know.</p>
<p>The entire campus is controlled by our group.</p>
<p>Our group is controlled by chicken, and the chicken is controlled by me.</p>
<p>Float? I'm good.</p>
<p>Abed, the mafia movie is over.</p>
<p>I'm not doing a mafia movie.</p>
<p>In fact, I don't need to use movies or TV shows to talk to people anymore.</p>
<p>Before I only needed them because the day-to-day world made no sense to me.</p>
<p>But now, everyone's speaking the same language, chicken.</p>
<p>I understand people and they finally understand me.</p>
<p>Abed, eventually people are gonna get tired of chicken.</p>
<p>I'm tired of chicken.</p>
<p>You're not tired of chicken.</p>
<p>You miss the taste of control.</p>
<p>Well, that's crazy.</p>
<p>Is it? Unfortunately, the very thing that drove you to this dorm room is what would prevent you from properly running this machine.</p>
<p>Or even being a cog in it, your ego.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I see, this has been about me the whole time.</p>
<p>You want a shot at the Jeff Winger throne? You better bring a powerful ass.</p>
<p>Oh, and for your information, I don't have an ego.</p>
<p>My Facebook photo is a landscape.</p>
<p>You're the best, Eduardo.</p>
<p>Thank you all for coming.</p>
<p>Can we make this quick? I need to give a banana to Annie's Boobs.</p>
<p>Abed is drunk with chicken power.</p>
<p>He's gone from lovable Johnny Five to evil HAL.</p>
<p>Hal Holb, not <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Hal Holbrook</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001358'>Hal Holbrook</a></span><span class='years'>1925&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>director</span><span class='tag prof'>writer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074119'>tt0074119</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758'>tt0758758</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080749'>tt0080749</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443272'>tt0443272</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>What are you saying? You all have to stop working for him.</p>
<p>Let this operation dry up and let his wheels spin down.</p>
<p>At which point you would be in charge again, right? What? This is so sad.</p>
<p>You're jealous of Abed because he's providing for us.</p>
<p>No, I'm concerned about Abed because he won't listen to reason.</p>
<p>Won't listen to your reason.</p>
<p>Why should he? Jeff's so not -</p>
<p>Say, "Streets ahead," and die.</p>
<p>Streets ahead.</p>
<p>You wanna boss me around? Get me an entourage.</p>
<p>Get Troy a monkey.</p>
<p>That's what a real boss does.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We probably shouldn't even be talking to him without checking with Abed.</p>
<p>I'm already trying him, he's not picking up.</p>
<p>What did you do with him? I don't believe what greedy sellouts you people turned out to be.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna stand and be ignored.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Voicemail.</p>
<p>Hey, Abed, Jeff says you're not listening to him.</p>
<p>Does that mean we shouldn't listen to him either? Oh, also, should we make special jackets for our crime family? Like blazers with chicken finger patches.</p>
<p>I don't know, long message, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Oh! Abed.</p>
<p>Look, I'm walking out this door right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>For real.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna look back.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Hi, hi, yeah.</p>
<p>Anybody need anything? Oh, everything, you look handsome.</p>
<p>I like everything about you now.</p>
<p>You get the message? I want a new hairdresser though.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>How's my hair look? Oh.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got you fired.</p>
<p>You deserved it.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>The question is, what do they deserve? Key to the kitchen.</p>
<p>There's a valve on the back of the chicken fryer that's not made anymore.</p>
<p>Now, say someone were to remove it.</p>
<p>The fryer wouldn't work.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>How petty do you think I am? Jeff leaving the family didn't turn out to be a problem.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we're set for the quiz.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>See you guys in class.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, before you go.</p>
<p>Oh, free notebooks.</p>
<p>But the family's success started to go to their heads.</p>
<p>They didn't have college ruled? No, sorry.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Abed? Yeah? Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure.</p>
<p>We have a situation.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Who is this? It's Travis.</p>
<p>You said you wanted someone in your entourage named Travis.</p>
<p>Show him your license.</p>
<p>Travis is his middle name.</p>
<p>I go by Travis.</p>
<p>No, you go by the door.</p>
<p>See you, Travis.</p>
<p>Abed? Yep? No, no, no.</p>
<p>My monkey hates this caviar.</p>
<p>Troy, isn't that? They were spoiled, fat, lazy.</p>
<p>I'd given them everything and somehow I'd lost their respect.</p>
<p>So I did the only thing I could think of.</p>
<p>I did what I thought Jeff would do.</p>
<p>I sent them a message.</p>
<p>Somebody's backpack.</p>
<p>These were the bad times.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Jeff, Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff, Abed killed my backpack.</p>
<p>I caught him stuffing my man full of chicken.</p>

<p>Look, I'm walking out this door right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>For real.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna look back.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Hi, hi, yeah.</p>
<p>Anybody need anything? Oh, everything, you look handsome.</p>
<p>I like everything about you now.</p>
<p>You get the message? I want a new hairdresser though.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>How's my hair look? Oh.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got you fired.</p>
<p>You deserved it.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>The question is, what do they deserve? Key to the kitchen.</p>
<p>There's a valve on the back of the chicken fryer that's not made anymore.</p>
<p>Now, say someone were to remove it.</p>
<p>The fryer wouldn't work.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>How petty do you think I am? Jeff leaving the family didn't turn out to be a problem.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we're set for the quiz.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>See you guys in class.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, before you go.</p>
<p>Oh, free notebooks.</p>
<p>But the family's success started to go to their heads.</p>
<p>They didn't have college ruled? No, sorry.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Abed? Yeah? Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure.</p>
<p>We have a situation.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Who is this? It's Travis.</p>
<p>You said you wanted someone in your entourage named Travis.</p>
<p>Show him your license.</p>
<p>Travis is his middle name.</p>
<p>I go by Travis.</p>
<p>No, you go by the door.</p>
<p>See you, Travis.</p>
<p>Abed? Yep? No, no, no.</p>
<p>My monkey hates this caviar.</p>
<p>Troy, isn't that? They were spoiled, fat, lazy.</p>
<p>I'd given them everything and somehow I'd lost their respect.</p>
<p>So I did the only thing I could think of.</p>
<p>I did what I thought Jeff would do.</p>
<p>I sent them a message.</p>
<p>Somebody's backpack.</p>
<p>These were the bad times.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Jeff, Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff, Abed killed my backpack.</p>
<p>I caught him stuffing my man full of chicken.</p>
<p>And Tyler Perry has a series of movies about why that's wrong.</p>
<p>That little Arab is off his rocker.</p>
<p>He released Annie's Boobs.</p>
<p>Annie's Boobs could be anywhere.</p>
<p>Could be We got it.</p>
<p>The monkey's name is Annie's Boobs.</p>
<p>Look what Abed did to my hair.</p>
<p>I feel terrible for all of you.</p>
<p>Wait, no, I don't, because I warned you about all this.</p>
<p>You were so high on your backpacks and hairstyles, you accused me of being jealous.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>But what can we do? I'm sorry, you brushed over that first part.</p>
<p>Together.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>Now, what you can do is go home and write that on your bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that make it seem like I was right? Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't have a mirror.</p>
<p>It's not reversed because you're the... you'd have the mirror behind you.</p>
<p>And I would like As for Abed, for his sake I guess I'll have to take him out.</p>
<p>Poor little guy.</p>
<p>Oh, good, that's nice.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Making Tater Tots.</p>
<p>You were right, people got sick of chicken, but I was close.</p>
<p>I just need a new food, a new system.</p>
<p>I'm gonna experiment with jalapeño poppers next, and then Zucchini Zircles.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>It's not that complicated, Jeff.</p>
<p>They replaced the C in circle with a Z for zucchini.</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, why are you here? You said you were close? What were you close to? To the group? To people? Don't do a special episode about me.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I wouldn't dream of it.</p>
<p>Everyone else needs my help.</p>
<p>That's what people don't get, is that they need to get me.</p>
<p>I just need to be able to connect to people like you can, and then I can make everyone happy.</p>
<p>Do you know why I'm here? You got caught with a fake degree.</p>
<p>By the way, they started using that on <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Law & Order</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844'>Law & Order</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1990&ndash;2010</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Mystery</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Total rip off.</p>
<p>I'm here to dismantle the fryer.</p>
<p>To cut your power off at its source.</p>
<p>Don't you see what happened? I manipulated the group into getting you the fry cook job so I could have some chicken.</p>
<p>And you turned it all into a way to make everyone like you.</p>
<p>Made me ashamed of myself, made me jealous.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a special episode.</p>
<p>It's pretty alarming behavior, Jeff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's specialists you could talk to.</p>
<p>Maybe I should do that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let's make a deal.</p>
<p>I'll help you connect with people, and you help me do a better job with them.</p>
<p>Like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Knight Rider</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083437'>Knight Rider</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1982&ndash;1986</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Knight Rider</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083437'>Knight Rider</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1982&ndash;1986</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>I'll put on a leather jacket and make out with an aerobics instructor.</p>
<p>You pull around front and comedically startle passers-by with your ability to talk.</p>
<p>Maybe we should just stay here and have a plate of chicken fingers.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Can we eat them while sitting on a table like in <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Sixteen Candles</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128'>Sixteen Candles</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1984&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Romance</span></span></span></span>? Pick one reference, Abed.</p>
<p><span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Sixteen Candles</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128'>Sixteen Candles</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1984&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Romance</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>And just like that, the mafia movie was over.</p>
<p>I quit the fry cook job, somewhat for the sake of the family, but mostly for the sake of Jeff's ego, poor guy.</p>
<p>Things went back to normal.</p>
<p>Everyone's back to being a bunch of regular schnooks.</p>
<p>And I'm back to being a weirdo.</p>
<p>Back to watching from the outside for now.</p>
<p>There's still not enough chicken fingers.</p>
<p>No way, no seriously.</p>
<p>What? As soon as our family moved out, a new syndicate moved in to take its place.</p>
<p>But you know what they'll never make a replacement for? Friends.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>That's great, Abed.</p>
<p>But could you just answer the question? What was it? Do you know who might have stolen a box of hairnets from the kitchen? Someone with hair.</p>
<p>I'm gonna write that down.</p>
<p>Ready? Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>Never been done.</p>
<p>Here I come.</p>
<p>Back up the same staircase.</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>Double escalator.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I haven't seen that before.</p>
<p>How did you think of that? And now for our signature trick.</p>
<p>Awesome elevator.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I can't do it.</p>
<p>I got babies.</p>
<p>I gotta get home.</p>
<p>It's their loss.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
