<p>So, boy, I don't know about you, but this sure feels like a real college to me.</p>
<p>Greendale, Greendale, Greendale.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Jeff, Jeff, good morning.</p>
<p>How is student life, my dry-witted friend? Probably the same as teacher life, but less tragic because I get to leave.</p>
<p>Very dry, very witty, not a great friend.</p>
<p>Listen, I wanted to ask you about that young lady in your Spanish class.</p>
<p>You know, the blond with the pouty, strident <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Cate Blanchett</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949'>Cate Blanchett</a></span><span class='years'>1969&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>director</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127536'>tt0127536</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338751'>tt0338751</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334873'>tt2334873</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402927'>tt2402927</a></span></span></span></span> sexuality and the ridiculous name.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Imagine living with that.</p>
<p>Can you imagine? Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Anyway, um, are you two an item? And if so, would that item be impervious to sabotage? You know, you have the savoir-faire of a hyena.</p>
<p>How is it that you and James Bond come from the same island? Message received.</p>
<p>I'll just wait for you to finish striking out first.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>M*A*S*H.</p>
<p>Fawlty Towers, game over.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>You think <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Luis Guzmán</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350079'>Luis Guzmán</a></span><span class='years'>1956&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>miscellaneous</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245844'>tt0245844</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272338'>tt0272338</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749'>tt0118749</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181865'>tt0181865</a></span></span></span></span> will come to visit his statue? If so, I'd like to ask him about his movie choices.</p>
<p>Particularly Carlito's Way, The Cowboy Way, The Hard Way and Q&A.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Luis Guzmán</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350079'>Luis Guzmán</a></span><span class='years'>1956&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>miscellaneous</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245844'>tt0245844</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272338'>tt0272338</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749'>tt0118749</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181865'>tt0181865</a></span></span></span></span> is on a private jet from Hollywood because he can't wait to have that conversation with you.</p>
<p>Really? How does he know about me? Because he called me on my cell phone.</p>
<p>Why would a movie actor call you? You don't know? No.</p>
<p>I'm President Obama's nephew.</p>
<p>You never mentioned that.</p>
<p>I didn't know if I could trust you, but now it's time to tell you everything.</p>
<p>Starting with me inventing the Ferrari.</p>
<p>So I guess the cell phone number you put on the group's contact sheet was fake.</p>
<p>Which I just learned in the conclusion of a month-long text-message affair with a dude from Boulder.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>Just give me your real number.</p>
<p>I'll cleanse my palate while Kevin rethinks his marriage.</p>
<p>I'll give you my number if you promise not to use it in any other context than friendship.</p>
<p>Uh, pass.</p>
<p>Star-Burns, that means you.</p>
<p>My name's Alex, dude.</p>
<p>Maybe you should spend five hours sculpting that in your face.</p>
<p>All right, last night I graded your tests.</p>
<p>I'm sure you wanna know how you did, right? Yes.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not gonna tell you until I find out who did this: What is that? It's a tiny piece of paper, okay? That's all it is.</p>
<p>A tiny piece of paper containing all the information covered on the test.</p>
<p>Otherwise known as a crib sheet.</p>
<p>Who did it, huh? Mary Ann? Grandpa? Jackée? Kumar? There's one Asian stereotype that does apply to me.</p>
<p>Whoever did this insulted my honor.</p>
<p>And they've got 24 hours to come forward or Mr. Miyagi here will wax off everyone's score and the whole class gets a zero.</p>
<p>Except you, Toby.</p>
<p>The only difference between Señor Chang and Stalin is that I know who Señor Chang is.</p>
<p>You hear him call me Jackée like I'm some black female caricature? If the good Lord hadn't been watching, I'd have slapped him upside the head.</p>
<p>Who do you guys think cheated? Flattering, but if I'm gonna cheat, I'm not gonna write information from a book onto paper.</p>
<p>That's practically learning, for God's sake.</p>
<p>Whoever made that crib sheet wasn't a real cheater, just insecure and naive.</p>
<p>I may be naive, but I'm not stupid.</p>
<p>Well, I may be stupid, but I'm not trying to look like I'm not.</p>
<p>Well, I may be a genius, but I'm not a lesbian.</p>
<p>Who cares who made the crib sheet? The only real cheater is the guy who's threatening everyone with a zero.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>It's so unfair.</p>
<p>I can't handle this kind of stress right now.</p>
<p>I'm already overwhelmed by my duties on the school song committee.</p>
<p>Are you a musician? Ew.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I hired a local composer, but he's quite a handful.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that's your fault, isn't it? It is? You got an accomplished pianist and songwriter sitting three feet away from you.</p>
<p>I wrote the jingle for Hawthorne Wipes towelettes.</p>
<p>I would've done your song for free.</p>
<p>Smooth move, Metamucil.</p>
<p>Troy could do the school song.</p>
<p>Troy invented rap music.</p>
<p>And he's related to <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Danny Glover</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000418'>Danny Glover</a></span><span class='years'>1946&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>director</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122151'>tt0122151</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080'>tt1190080</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104714'>tt0104714</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093409'>tt0093409</a></span></span></span></span> and President Obama.</p>
<p>Abed, have you been racist this whole time while I'm telling everybody at church what a sweet little caramel angel you are? Hey man, that stuff I said this morning wasn't true.</p>
<p>I was just messing with you.</p>
<p>You were lying? Yeah, as a joke.</p>
<p>You You never had somebody mess with you before? Yes, just kidding.</p>
<p>No, like that? This isn't a table.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to study Spanish? Pierce.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>I talked to the dean and he said you can write Greendale's school song.</p>
<p>Well, that's more like it.</p>
<p>You know, the statue dedication is this Friday, so have it done by then.</p>
<p>This Friday? This Friday? If that's not enough time--</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You really don't know much about genius, do you? Yes, I can do it by Friday.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>There's a piano in the rehearsal space and I'll help you out however I can.</p>
<p>You're gonna do an awesome job.</p>
<p>I know! So this is the last chance for the cheater to be an adult and face la música or everyone fails.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You've got 10 seconds, starting now.</p>
<p>No! I've never gotten a zero before.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Britta? Wow.</p>
<p>You really took your sweet time with that one.</p>
<p>How dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades? It's not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other.</p>
<p>Turn on her.</p>
<p>Real mature.</p>
<p>God, Britta.</p>
<p>That's right, we are mature.</p>
<p>Too mature to sit in a class with a cheating, lying, poop face.</p>
<p>Okay, time to learn some formal greetings.</p>
<p>So, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bet you're enjoying this.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, when we first met, like, you were up here and I was here.</p>
<p>And now--oh, wait, I gave a quarter to a dirty bum today.</p>
<p>What do you think they're gonna do to me? Well, we're not gonna buy you an ice cream.</p>
<p>Hi, Dean Pelton.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Quite an entrance I got to make there.</p>
<p>You would be Britta Perry? I just spoke with Señor Chang.</p>
<p>And I'm afraid Greendale takes this kind of thing very seriously.</p>
<p>Much like a university would.</p>
<p>Your case will be reviewed by disciplinary tribunal tomorrow in Borchart Hall.</p>
<p>You could be facing expulsion.</p>
<p>Isn't Borchart Hall the pool? There is an Olympic-sized pool there, yes.</p>
<p>But we will be next to it, using its $6000 judge's table.</p>
<p>Uh, is she allowed to have counsel? I mean, I may not be a practicing lawyer anymore, but relative to this place, I'm Alan Dershowitz.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, ouch.</p>
<p>And, yes, if you'd like, you may represent her.</p>
<p>Dean you later.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal gets its jollies judging me.</p>
<p>Hey, if you show up with me, follow my lead, and deny everything, you'll walk.</p>
<p>That's the Winger guarantee.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>You think you're gonna save my bacon using your lawyer powers and send me into fits of grateful arousal.</p>
<p>I can neither confirm nor deny that.</p>
<p>See how good I am? Hey, Troy, did you hear? All dogs are blue now.</p>
<p>Every single dog in the world is blue.</p>
<p>I'm just messing with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But let me explain to you a few things about how this works.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, I cannot be got.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Because I am not gullible like you.</p>
<p>Secondly, you are not good at this, because you are not believable in your face, okay? Your face? Yeah? It's bad.</p>
<p>Um, okay.</p>
<p>Also, you gotta ride the line between believable and--what are you writing in? It's a notepad.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what, what language? It's probably Arabic.</p>
<p>All right, uh, I am convening this disciplinary tribunal at our state-of-the-art judge's table.</p>
<p>Which has it's own built-in sound system.</p>
<p>So take that, Yale.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Our judges include, uh, myself, uh, Dean Craig Pelton.</p>
<p>Professor Ian Duncan.</p>
<p>Professor Ben Chang.</p>
<p>Uh, no, you're a teacher, you're not a professor.</p>
<p>Well, maybe because I don't look like Ron Weasley.</p>
<p>That's the difference, that's the qualifying factor.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, point of order.</p>
<p>How can Señor Chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.</p>
<p>You got Prince Charles over here as your drinking buddy.</p>
<p>Oh, got me.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like there are two biases, one on each side.</p>
<p>And I go both ways.</p>
<p>Oh, let's strike that.</p>
<p>LaShonda, can we please strike that? I am impartial, so it should all work out.</p>
<p>Okay, let's begin.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Uh, the tribunal calls teacher Chang.</p>
<p>Okay, just keep it up, Frost Nixon.</p>
<p>I was planning on doing that.</p>
<p>Cleared my whole day.</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. Chang, could you remind us of the events of yesterday? Oh, with great pleasure.</p>
<p>It was a Tuesday, uh, crack of dawn, 5:58 a.m.</p>
<p>I got up, I took my morning deuce.</p>
<p>I made a breakfast consisting of…</p>
<p># Greendale, Greendale #</p>
<p># Slop pail #</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Green, green, green.</p>
<p># Greendale isn't a slop pail #</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm almost done.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>You can tell the dean you will have a song that'll make the devil poop God's pants.</p>
<p>That's exciting.</p>
<p>Mind if I hear what you got so far? Well, yeah, sure, I, uh, I'll probably open with something like this.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, a note like that.</p>
<p>And end with a note like that.</p>
<p>The words, I can't tell you.</p>
<p>You know, the rest is really a surprise.</p>
<p>I'm just a little worried.</p>
<p>I keep hearing the same two notes.</p>
<p>And your sheet music looks like a Chinese takeout menu.</p>
<p>A musician sees music in everything, Annie.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be -</p>
<p># Moo shu pork #</p>
<p># Squab with lettuce #</p>
<p>You see? I mean, it just comes out.</p>
<p>You really shouldn't be here right now.</p>
<p>What? You are inside a throbbing, cosmic womb of creativity.</p>
<p>And when this baby starts kicking, I cannot be responsible for your sanity.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>I know it sounds funny, but let me play you out, okay? Playing you out now, this song.</p>
<p>You know, like on stage? Playing you out, okay? Thanks for coming.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Then she yelled, "Screw you."</p>
<p>Or, "Screw education."</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>Then she stormed out of the room in her high-heel boots like it was tampon time.</p>
<p>If you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>I don't know what he means.</p>
<p>Please don't encourage him.</p>
<p>Do you have any more questions? The defense calls Britta Perry.</p>
<p>Now are those the high-heel boots he was talking about? Yes.</p>
<p>Are they comfortable? Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm just curious.</p>
<p>They're cute.</p>
<p>Miss Perry, did you make that crib sheet? No.</p>
<p>She confessed.</p>
<p>She confessed to protect her classmates because you were threatening to flunk everyone.</p>
<p>You did what? Oh.</p>
<p>Shut your pompous vortex of overlapping fangs.</p>
<p>Hey, British dentistry is not on trial.</p>
<p>Dean Pelton, I move this case be thrown out of the pool area.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly sounds to me that this young lady's only crime is being a hero and wanting to be taller.</p>
<p>This tribunal is adjourned.</p>
<p>Wait, I cheated.</p>
<p>And we're back.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>My client did not cheat.</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>Yes, she did.</p>
<p>But why? That's the real question, isn't it? The world wasn't the only thing that changed on September 11th.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff, come on.</p>
<p>Five minute recess? No, no.</p>
<p>There's nothing in the bylaws about recesses, all right? The wheels of justice here don't stop just because--oh! I know, everyone, time out, time out.</p>
<p>Save the table, save the table.</p>
<p>Beginning transmission.</p>
<p>The primary purpose seems to be male bonding.</p>
<p>And the attitude during conveyance of the random deceit is apparently of great importance.</p>
<p>The humanoid is approximately--</p>
<p>What are you doing? Oh, hey, Troy.</p>
<p>I didn't see you.</p>
<p>Uh, how long were you standing there? You trying to mess with me? Yes.</p>
<p>That's what I was doing.</p>
<p>You got me.</p>
<p>I was just messing with you, but I guess I blew it again.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did.</p>
<p>Don't turn your back on me, thinking you're all hoity-toity.</p>
<p>Have you got a problem with me? I don't like the fact that you're walking around here, like you're better than me, in front of my students.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, do you mind if we have this conversation in a room with less balls? You, you're very confident, I'll say that.</p>
<p>But you shouldn't be.</p>
<p>What are you doing out there? You know I have a problem with dishonesty.</p>
<p>You're on trial for cheating.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Look, we'll be fine.</p>
<p>I just have go back out there and make the case that you're a good person.</p>
<p>You don't know that.</p>
<p>You're just doing all this because you wanna sleep with me.</p>
<p>I mean you said it yourself, you don't even wanna be my friend.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait.</p>
<p>Is that, is that what you thought I meant? Britta, look at me.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>No, look how handsome my face is.</p>
<p>If all I wanted was sex, I could get it from plenty of women without having to go through all this crap.</p>
<p>I'm here because I like you.</p>
<p>And I'd, I'd be psyched to be your friend.</p>
<p>I just didn't wanna take sex off the table without doing my due diligence.</p>
<p>I actually believe you.</p>
<p>Well, why wouldn't you? I don't know.</p>
<p>I guess the same reason that I cheated.</p>
<p>I just have more experience being worthless.</p>
<p>I think I left that crib sheet on the floor because I wanted to get caught at it.</p>
<p>I'm so used to screwing everything up, I just wanted to get it over with.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I think we have our defense.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, my client is insane.</p>
<p>What? Gentlemen, I'm sure you suspected that Miss Perry was pretty odd before the recess.</p>
<p>But if you could've heard all the stuff she just told me in the shower, you would realize she is all the way out of her entire damn mind.</p>
<p>She doesn't want to succeed because she doesn't think she can.</p>
<p>So she goes out of her way to fail.</p>
<p>That's crazy.</p>
<p>But do we really wanna make it a crime to be crazy at Greendale? I mean, look at us.</p>
<p>I mean, you two are arguing about status at a college that correspondence schools make fun of.</p>
<p>Dean, you want so bad for this place to be Ivy League that you are putting us at risk of electrocution.</p>
<p>Because everyone on this campus is nuts.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Leonard.</p>
<p>If you're gonna argue with me, put on a bathing suit.</p>
<p>Busted.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>If you wanna rehabilitate your fellow inmate, you need to sentence her to staying here with us.</p>
<p>Because if crazy people can't be at Greendale, where are we supposed to go? Wow.</p>
<p>Well, under the circumstances, I recommend that the accused be fully exonerated.</p>

<p>Well, he is rather arrogant and has no mercy for weaker beings.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop doing this right now.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I'm not an alien.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>I never thought you were.</p>
<p>But this is insane, okay? Those are credible alien hand movements.</p>
<p>You invented a whole language.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you rented a green screen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It would be less creepy if you were actually an alien.</p>
<p>But this is what friends do.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It--from now on, Abed, friends don't mess with each other.</p>
<p>Okay, cool? Cool, cool.</p>
<p>Bang-bang.</p>
<p>Garrett, it's over.</p>

<p>Well, you shouldn't.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>You listen up, Pierce.</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell you what my mother told me when I wanted to quit cheerleading.</p>
<p>"You're not very pretty, you have no boobs, and you can't do a basket toss to save your life, but you made a commitment."</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Luis Guzmán is on a private jet from Hollywood because he can't wait to have that conversation with you.</p>
<p>Really? How does he know about me? Because he called me on my cell phone.</p>
<p>Why would a movie actor call you? You don't know? No.</p>
<p>I'm President Obama's nephew.</p>
<p>You never mentioned that.</p>
<p>I didn't know if I could trust you, but now it's time to tell you everything.</p>
<p>Starting with me inventing the Ferrari.</p>
<p>So I guess the cell phone number you put on the group's contact sheet was fake.</p>
<p>Which I just learned in the conclusion of a month-long text-message affair with a dude from Boulder.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>Just give me your real number.</p>
<p>I'll cleanse my palate while Kevin rethinks his marriage.</p>
<p>I'll give you my number if you promise not to use it in any other context than friendship.</p>
<p>Uh, pass.</p>
<p>Star-Burns, that means you.</p>
<p>My name's Alex, dude.</p>
<p>Maybe you should spend five hours sculpting that in your face.</p>
<p>All right, last night I graded your tests.</p>
<p>I'm sure you wanna know how you did, right? Yes.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not gonna tell you until I find out who did this: What is that? It's a tiny piece of paper, okay? That's all it is.</p>
<p>A tiny piece of paper containing all the information covered on the test.</p>
<p>Otherwise known as a crib sheet.</p>
<p>Who did it, huh? Mary Ann? Grandpa? Jackée? Kumar? There's one Asian stereotype that does apply to me.</p>
<p>Whoever did this insulted my honor.</p>
<p>And they've got 24 hours to come forward or Mr. Miyagi here will wax off everyone's score and the whole class gets a zero.</p>
<p>Except you, Toby.</p>
<p>The only difference between Señor Chang and Stalin is that I know who Señor Chang is.</p>
<p>You hear him call me Jackée like I'm some black female caricature? If the good Lord hadn't been watching, I'd have slapped him upside the head.</p>
<p>Who do you guys think cheated? Flattering, but if I'm gonna cheat, I'm not gonna write information from a book onto paper.</p>
<p>That's practically learning, for God's sake.</p>
<p>Whoever made that crib sheet wasn't a real cheater, just insecure and naive.</p>
<p>I may be naive, but I'm not stupid.</p>
<p>Well, I may be stupid, but I'm not trying to look like I'm not.</p>
<p>Well, I may be a genius, but I'm not a lesbian.</p>
<p>Who cares who made the crib sheet? The only real cheater is the guy who's threatening everyone with a zero.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>It's so unfair.</p>
<p>I can't handle this kind of stress right now.</p>
<p>I'm already overwhelmed by my duties on the school song committee.</p>
<p>Are you a musician? Ew.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I hired a local composer, but he's quite a handful.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that's your fault, isn't it? It is? You got an accomplished pianist and songwriter sitting three feet away from you.</p>
<p>I wrote the jingle for Hawthorne Wipes towelettes.</p>
<p>I would've done your song for free.</p>
<p>Smooth move, Metamucil.</p>
<p>Troy could do the school song.</p>
<p>Troy invented rap music.</p>
<p>And he's related to Danny Glover and President Obama.</p>
<p>Abed, have you been racist this whole time while I'm telling everybody at church what a sweet little caramel angel you are? Hey man, that stuff I said this morning wasn't true.</p>
<p>I was just messing with you.</p>
<p>You were lying? Yeah, as a joke.</p>
<p>You You never had somebody mess with you before? Yes, just kidding.</p>
<p>No, like that? This isn't a table.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to study Spanish? Pierce.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>I talked to the dean and he said you can write Greendale's school song.</p>
<p>Well, that's more like it.</p>
<p>You know, the statue dedication is this Friday, so have it done by then.</p>
<p>This Friday? This Friday? If that's not enough time--</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You really don't know much about genius, do you? Yes, I can do it by Friday.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>There's a piano in the rehearsal space and I'll help you out however I can.</p>
<p>You're gonna do an awesome job.</p>
<p>I know! So this is the last chance for the cheater to be an adult and face la música or everyone fails.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You've got 10 seconds, starting now.</p>
<p>No! I've never gotten a zero before.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Britta? Wow.</p>
<p>You really took your sweet time with that one.</p>
<p>How dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades? It's not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other.</p>
<p>Turn on her.</p>
<p>Real mature.</p>
<p>God, Britta.</p>
<p>That's right, we are mature.</p>
<p>Too mature to sit in a class with a cheating, lying, poop face.</p>
<p>Okay, time to learn some formal greetings.</p>
<p>So, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bet you're enjoying this.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, when we first met, like, you were up here and I was here.</p>
<p>And now--oh, wait, I gave a quarter to a dirty bum today.</p>
<p>What do you think they're gonna do to me? Well, we're not gonna buy you an ice cream.</p>
<p>Hi, Dean Pelton.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Quite an entrance I got to make there.</p>
<p>You would be Britta Perry? I just spoke with Señor Chang.</p>
<p>And I'm afraid Greendale takes this kind of thing very seriously.</p>
<p>Much like a university would.</p>
<p>Your case will be reviewed by disciplinary tribunal tomorrow in Borchart Hall.</p>
<p>You could be facing expulsion.</p>
<p>Isn't Borchart Hall the pool? There is an Olympic-sized pool there, yes.</p>
<p>But we will be next to it, using its $6000 judge's table.</p>
<p>Uh, is she allowed to have counsel? I mean, I may not be a practicing lawyer anymore, but relative to this place, I'm Alan Dershowitz.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, ouch.</p>
<p>And, yes, if you'd like, you may represent her.</p>
<p>Dean you later.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal gets its jollies judging me.</p>
<p>Hey, if you show up with me, follow my lead, and deny everything, you'll walk.</p>
<p>That's the Winger guarantee.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>You think you're gonna save my bacon using your lawyer powers and send me into fits of grateful arousal.</p>
<p>I can neither confirm nor deny that.</p>
<p>See how good I am? Hey, Troy, did you hear? All dogs are blue now.</p>
<p>Every single dog in the world is blue.</p>
<p>I'm just messing with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But let me explain to you a few things about how this works.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, I cannot be got.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Because I am not gullible like you.</p>
<p>Secondly, you are not good at this, because you are not believable in your face, okay? Your face? Yeah? It's bad.</p>
<p>Um, okay.</p>
<p>Also, you gotta ride the line between believable and--what are you writing in? It's a notepad.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what, what language? It's probably Arabic.</p>
<p>All right, uh, I am convening this disciplinary tribunal at our state-of-the-art judge's table.</p>
<p>Which has it's own built-in sound system.</p>
<p>So take that, Yale.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Our judges include, uh, myself, uh, Dean Craig Pelton.</p>
<p>Professor Ian Duncan.</p>
<p>Professor Ben Chang.</p>
<p>Uh, no, you're a teacher, you're not a professor.</p>
<p>Well, maybe because I don't look like Ron Weasley.</p>
<p>That's the difference, that's the qualifying factor.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, point of order.</p>
<p>How can Señor Chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.</p>
<p>You got Prince Charles over here as your drinking buddy.</p>
<p>Oh, got me.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like there are two biases, one on each side.</p>
<p>And I go both ways.</p>
<p>Oh, let's strike that.</p>
<p>LaShonda, can we please strike that? I am impartial, so it should all work out.</p>
<p>Okay, let's begin.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Uh, the tribunal calls teacher Chang.</p>
<p>Okay, just keep it up, Frost Nixon.</p>
<p>I was planning on doing that.</p>
<p>Cleared my whole day.</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. Chang, could you remind us of the events of yesterday? Oh, with great pleasure.</p>
<p>It was a Tuesday, uh, crack of dawn, 5:58 a.m.</p>
<p>I got up, I took my morning deuce.</p>
<p>I made a breakfast consisting of…</p>
<p># Greendale, Greendale #</p>
<p># Slop pail #</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Green, green, green.</p>
<p># Greendale isn't a slop pail #</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm almost done.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>You can tell the dean you will have a song that'll make the devil poop God's pants.</p>
<p>That's exciting.</p>
<p>Mind if I hear what you got so far? Well, yeah, sure, I, uh, I'll probably open with something like this.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, a note like that.</p>
<p>And end with a note like that.</p>
<p>The words, I can't tell you.</p>
<p>You know, the rest is really a surprise.</p>
<p>I'm just a little worried.</p>
<p>I keep hearing the same two notes.</p>
<p>And your sheet music looks like a Chinese takeout menu.</p>
<p>A musician sees music in everything, Annie.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be -</p>
<p># Moo shu pork #</p>
<p># Squab with lettuce #</p>
<p>You see? I mean, it just comes out.</p>
<p>You really shouldn't be here right now.</p>
<p>What? You are inside a throbbing, cosmic womb of creativity.</p>
<p>And when this baby starts kicking, I cannot be responsible for your sanity.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>I know it sounds funny, but let me play you out, okay? Playing you out now, this song.</p>
<p>You know, like on stage? Playing you out, okay? Thanks for coming.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Then she yelled, "Screw you."</p>
<p>Or, "Screw education."</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>Then she stormed out of the room in her high-heel boots like it was tampon time.</p>
<p>If you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>I don't know what he means.</p>
<p>Please don't encourage him.</p>
<p>Do you have any more questions? The defense calls Britta Perry.</p>
<p>Now are those the high-heel boots he was talking about? Yes.</p>
<p>Are they comfortable? Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm just curious.</p>
<p>They're cute.</p>
<p>Miss Perry, did you make that crib sheet? No.</p>
<p>She confessed.</p>
<p>She confessed to protect her classmates because you were threatening to flunk everyone.</p>
<p>You did what? Oh.</p>
<p>Shut your pompous vortex of overlapping fangs.</p>
<p>Hey, British dentistry is not on trial.</p>
<p>Dean Pelton, I move this case be thrown out of the pool area.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly sounds to me that this young lady's only crime is being a hero and wanting to be taller.</p>
<p>This tribunal is adjourned.</p>
<p>Wait, I cheated.</p>
<p>And we're back.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>My client did not cheat.</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>Yes, she did.</p>
<p>But why? That's the real question, isn't it? The world wasn't the only thing that changed on September 11th.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff, come on.</p>
<p>Five minute recess? No, no.</p>
<p>There's nothing in the bylaws about recesses, all right? The wheels of justice here don't stop just because--oh! I know, everyone, time out, time out.</p>
<p>Save the table, save the table.</p>
<p>Beginning transmission.</p>
<p>The primary purpose seems to be male bonding.</p>
<p>And the attitude during conveyance of the random deceit is apparently of great importance.</p>
<p>The humanoid is approximately--</p>
<p>What are you doing? Oh, hey, Troy.</p>
<p>I didn't see you.</p>
<p>Uh, how long were you standing there? You trying to mess with me? Yes.</p>
<p>That's what I was doing.</p>
<p>You got me.</p>
<p>I was just messing with you, but I guess I blew it again.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did.</p>
<p>Don't turn your back on me, thinking you're all hoity-toity.</p>
<p>Have you got a problem with me? I don't like the fact that you're walking around here, like you're better than me, in front of my students.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, do you mind if we have this conversation in a room with less balls? You, you're very confident, I'll say that.</p>
<p>But you shouldn't be.</p>
<p>What are you doing out there? You know I have a problem with dishonesty.</p>
<p>You're on trial for cheating.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Look, we'll be fine.</p>
<p>I just have go back out there and make the case that you're a good person.</p>
<p>You don't know that.</p>
<p>You're just doing all this because you wanna sleep with me.</p>
<p>I mean you said it yourself, you don't even wanna be my friend.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait.</p>
<p>Is that, is that what you thought I meant? Britta, look at me.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>No, look how handsome my face is.</p>
<p>If all I wanted was sex, I could get it from plenty of women without having to go through all this crap.</p>
<p>I'm here because I like you.</p>
<p>And I'd, I'd be psyched to be your friend.</p>
<p>I just didn't wanna take sex off the table without doing my due diligence.</p>
<p>I actually believe you.</p>
<p>Well, why wouldn't you? I don't know.</p>
<p>I guess the same reason that I cheated.</p>
<p>I just have more experience being worthless.</p>
<p>I think I left that crib sheet on the floor because I wanted to get caught at it.</p>
<p>I'm so used to screwing everything up, I just wanted to get it over with.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I think we have our defense.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, my client is insane.</p>
<p>What? Gentlemen, I'm sure you suspected that Miss Perry was pretty odd before the recess.</p>
<p>But if you could've heard all the stuff she just told me in the shower, you would realize she is all the way out of her entire damn mind.</p>
<p>She doesn't want to succeed because she doesn't think she can.</p>
<p>So she goes out of her way to fail.</p>
<p>That's crazy.</p>
<p>But do we really wanna make it a crime to be crazy at Greendale? I mean, look at us.</p>
<p>I mean, you two are arguing about status at a college that correspondence schools make fun of.</p>
<p>Dean, you want so bad for this place to be Ivy League that you are putting us at risk of electrocution.</p>
<p>Because everyone on this campus is nuts.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Leonard.</p>
<p>If you're gonna argue with me, put on a bathing suit.</p>
<p>Busted.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>If you wanna rehabilitate your fellow inmate, you need to sentence her to staying here with us.</p>
<p>Because if crazy people can't be at Greendale, where are we supposed to go? Wow.</p>
<p>Well, under the circumstances, I recommend that the accused be fully exonerated.</p>
<p>On the condition that she receives psychological counseling on a weekly basis from a trained mental health professional.</p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe Fridays, All in favor say "aye."</p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>What? That just happened.</p>
<p>Greetings, Abed.</p>
<p>Greetings, Abed.</p>
<p>Greetings, commander.</p>
<p>Tell me about the one they call Troy.</p>
<p>Well, he is rather arrogant and has no mercy for weaker beings.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop doing this right now.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I'm not an alien.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>I never thought you were.</p>
<p>But this is insane, okay? Those are credible alien hand movements.</p>
<p>You invented a whole language.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you rented a green screen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It would be less creepy if you were actually an alien.</p>
<p>But this is what friends do.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It--from now on, Abed, friends don't mess with each other.</p>
<p>Okay, cool? Cool, cool.</p>
<p>Bang-bang.</p>
<p>Garrett, it's over.</p>
<p>He knows.</p>
<p>You're getting a little sloppy.</p>
<p>We went over budget.</p>
<p>I've got it.</p>
<p># Greendale, Greendale, little star #</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I can't. Reject.</p>
<p>I'm a fraud, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm no more of a songwriter than you or Billy Joel.</p>
<p>But what about the Hawthorne Wipes jingle? Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Sure, the whole thing.</p>
<p>You wanna hear it? Here.</p>
<p># You'll be wiping off that ketchup #</p>
<p># With our wipes #</p>
<p># Hawthorne Wipes #</p>
<p># You'll be wiping off that mustard #</p>
<p># With our wipes #</p>
<p># At the picnic #</p>
<p>That's "She'll be Comin' Around the Mountain."</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I steal everything.</p>
<p>You backed the wrong horse.</p>
<p>I got nothing.</p>
<p>Pierce, you're musical.</p>
<p>You're creative, you can do this.</p>
<p>I believe in you.</p>
<p>Well, you shouldn't.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>You listen up, Pierce.</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell you what my mother told me when I wanted to quit cheerleading.</p>
<p>"You're not very pretty, you have no boobs, and you can't do a basket toss to save your life, but you made a commitment."</p>
<p>So pick up your pom-poms, Pierce.</p>
<p>Stuff your bra, and get ready for the team bus to forget you at a Taco Bell because life is tough.</p>
<p>But we soldier on, and that's just the way it goes.</p>
<p>I'm gonna play myself out.</p>
<p>"The way it goes."</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>One, two, Luis Guzmán.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>All right, Luis.</p>
<p>You know, Greendale may never be Harvard--</p>
<p>Don't talk to me for a while.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Just glad you're here.</p>
<p>With that, I'd like to introduce our student, Pierce Hawthorne, who's written Greendale its own school song.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Pierce, okay.</p>
<p>Thank you, dean, thank you.</p>
<p>This song goes out to Annie for believing in me.</p>
<p># Standing in the bookstore line #</p>
<p># Waiting for the bell to chime #</p>
<p># So you can go to class #</p>
<p># Dancing in your underwear #</p>
<p># Taking air conditioner repair #</p>
<p>Is this Bruce Hornsby's? Yup.</p>
<p>Does he know he stole it? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Let him enjoy it.</p>
<p>Could we get sued? Not sure.</p>
<p># Greendale's the way it goes #</p>
<p>Yeah, they got us.</p>
<p># Some things are still the same #</p>
<p># Slop pails and pantyhose #</p>
<p># Oh, Annie believes in me #</p>
<p>How many? Thirty-six.</p>
<p>You win.</p>
<p>Best of three? Yeah.</p>
<p>Aaah.</p>
<p></p>
