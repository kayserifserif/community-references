<p>Well, see you after the break.</p>
<p>What you doing for Thanksgiving? I'm having Andre's family over.</p>
<p>Though he'll be stuck working for Black Friday.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, you get to say that, but we're stuck calling it Jew Friday.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I'll be with my family, fielding the same old questions.</p>
<p>"How's community college?" "What's your major?" "Are those real?"</p>
<p>My aunt's boyfriend.</p>
<p>Aw. My family's a normal religion.</p>
<p>I have to talk to them for five minutes before I get a casserole that's all marshmallow.</p>
<p>That's you.</p>
<p>Brainstorm.</p>
<p>Why don't you all come to my house? I'll have plenty of food.</p>
<p>Marshmallows! Sounds good.</p>
<p>Was gonna microwave noodles.</p>
<p>This sounds promising.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Goody.</p>
<p>You're all welcome, of course.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Or, you know, Jeff or whoever.</p>
<p>Can't.</p>
<p>Plans.</p>
<p>If you change your mind, can't think of anyone who'd enjoy you more.</p>
<p>How-dean, pilgrims? Is that-- ? <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>John Wayne</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000078'>John Wayne</a></span><span class='years'>1907&ndash;1979</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057298'>tt0057298</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056217'>tt0056217</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053580'>tt0053580</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065126'>tt0065126</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, good, you got it.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I just thought I'd mosey on over here, invite you all to Greendale's annual thanks-living potluck dinner, where we remember all we have to be thankful for.</p>
<p>There may be a link to enrollment at Greendale and holiday suicide.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Just a shoelace and belt-free night full of fun.</p>
<p>You should all drop by.</p>
<p>Or Jeff, or whoever.</p>
<p>He can't.</p>
<p>He has plans.</p>
<p>Right, you are spending Thanksgiving with your father.</p>
<p>I thought I told you to stop reading my e-mail.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I thought I told you to stop keeping secrets.</p>
<p>How am to keep track of what you tell me in confidence and what I hear through your walls with a glass to my ear? Fine.</p>
<p>Close your mouths.</p>
<p>I'm having Thanksgiving with my estranged father.</p>
<p>Move on.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>Jeff's at a point in his life where he needs a strong father figure to come out to.</p>
<p>Jeff, this is huge news.</p>
<p>Huger news.</p>
<p>Was this decision made after our Halloween conversation? Yes, after, not because of.</p>
<p>I'll take it.</p>
<p>You had that teed up? When I say "thera", you say "pist" Thera Pist Thera-- Aw.</p>
<p>Thanks for the support.</p>
<p>Oh, the support has just begun.</p>
<p>What do you want me to bring to Papa Winger's house? Vegan pumpkin pie? Britta, you're not coming.</p>
<p>Fine, regular pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>You're gonna need me when things get messy and emotional.</p>
<p>The thing that will get emotional is Troy when he realizes there are yams under those marshmallows.</p>
<p>I knew it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>Jeff, speaking not just as your friend but as an avid daytime-TV watcher, these parent-child reunions can get intense.</p>
<p>Chairs might be thrown, weaves might be pulled.</p>
<p>Or I could just go in there, show him how awesome I am, no thanks to him, meet my half-brother and then, boom, closure.</p>
<p>Your dad has another son? Yeah.</p>
<p>So clearly, he's moved on.</p>
<p>Why can't I? Close your mouths.</p>
<p>Look, I appreciate your concern.</p>
<p>But the most helpful thing you can do is stay out of my business.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Can you say that last part again? These walls are entirely too thick.</p>
<p>Oh! Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Let's carve that jive turkey.</p>
<p>Got that out of your system? Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm happy to welcome you to my home.</p>
<p>Â©hu iï¬hmk yam, Come in.</p>
<p>Take your coats off.</p>
<p>Make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p>Browse the available literature about Jesus as your personal savior, or not.</p>
<p>No agenda.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Are you gonna pass some apps soon or do I have to die of starvation to prove a point? This is Mr. Bennett, my father-in-law.</p>
<p>Dad, these are my friends from college.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That's Andre's people.</p>
<p>They're a bunch of characters.</p>
<p>That's a good one, Dad.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I brought something.</p>
<p>Dip.</p>
<p>Oh, Abed, why is this seven-layer dip so puffy? Been in the fridge for two years.</p>
<p>Saving it for a special occasion.</p>
<p>So thoughtful.</p>
<p>I'm gonna put this on a nice platter with crackers in the trash.</p>
<p>Where's Britta? Hey, Jeff.</p>
<p>What's up? What's up is closure.</p>
<p>I met my dad, we talked things out as men.</p>
<p>I think I'm ready to move on.</p>
<p>Really, in 20 minutes'? Fine.</p>
<p>Look, I couldn't do it.</p>
<p>I was at the front door, in control, and then I started thinking about all that stuff you said about messiness.</p>
<p>Threw me off my game.</p>
<p>The irony is after all your pestering that I deal with my daddy issues, you're the reason I'm not meeting my father.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm the reason you'll come here after all.</p>
<p>Britta, I-- Wait.</p>
<p>What do you mean by here? Your dad's house, where I kind of, sort of, am.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks, Sharon.</p>
<p>I never thought about it that way.</p>
<p>Batman is sort of gay.</p>
<p>Be right back.</p>
<p>What is going on? Why is Thanksgiving so terrible? I know.</p>
<p>The tension, the backbiting, the judgmental comments.</p>
<p>This makes Thanksgiving with my family look-- Eh.</p>
<p>Still pretty bad.</p>
<p>I said Batman was gay.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p>
<p>You ask one lady if she's Tyler Perry in drag and suddenly, you're the bad guy.</p>
<p>It's a reference.</p>
<p>That's my humor.</p>
<p>Abed gets it.</p>
<p>Oh, you're all hiding out in here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know us, hide away.</p>
<p>"Hiding"? Well, be careful.</p>
<p>You might be giving the impression that you prefer the cold garage to the warm hearth of my hospitality.</p>
<p>What? As if.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, hurry back soon.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the Jonestown of dinners.</p>
<p>Feel like I'm in jail.</p>
<p>You know what happens to guys like me in jail.</p>
<p>They get really into push-ups.</p>
<p>I am fine with my upper body the way it is.</p>
<p>It did feel like a prison, and that meant only one thing made sense conceptually.</p>

<p>Psychology tells us there are no accidents.</p>
<p>Oh, really? What about car accidents? Tara Reid, or the Hindenburg? Here goes nothing.</p>
<p>Hello, William.</p>
<p>So, uh, how about we make a couple of ground rules? Actually, that sounds good.</p>
<p>No hugs.</p>
<p>Wouldn't want one.</p>
<p>No apologies.</p>
<p>Wouldn't accept one.</p>
<p>No calling you "dad." </p>
<p>No expectations.</p>
<p>No BS.</p>
<p>Drink? Eighteen? Scotch.</p>
<p>Neat.</p>
<p>I just want to acknowledge there are a lot of emotions flowing right now.</p>
<p>You two are probably feeling a strong impulse to sleep with each other, and hey, that's normal.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I'll get the drinks.</p>
<p>So how about that? No muss, no fuss.</p>
<p>Jeff, I urge you not to run from the muss and fuss.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You must be my half-brother.</p>
<p>Your hands are so much bigger than mine.</p>
<p>Your nail beds are perfect.</p>
<p>I can't do it.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Oh, it's coming up.</p>
<p>When I get upset, I vomit.</p>
<p>Oh, I see you've met Willy, Jr.</p>
<p>You said he wasn't gonna replace me.</p>
<p>He's the Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>I'm the DeVito.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Okay, fellas, let's get right into it.</p>
<p>I think the big question on everyone's mind is why don't I go help Willy, Jr.</p>
<p>? Hm? One thing was clear to me and the crew.</p>
<p>Bennett lockup was not where we belonged.</p>
<p>We belonged in the sun, with the wind in our hair.</p>
<p>Maybe at a Bennigan's, enjoying a Turkey O'Toole.</p>
<p>We should tunnel out.</p>
<p>Abed, Shirley is our friend, and we're guests in her home.</p>
<p>We need a plan that won't hurt her feelings or damage her property.</p>
<p>Definitely don't look behind that poster, then.</p>
<p>I could pretend to have a stroke.</p>
<p>Do a gibberish foreign language.</p>
<p>What if I did a gibberish foreign language like Star Wars? You'd like that, I bet.</p>
<p>Dick.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sure we'll figure out a way out of here.</p>
<p>What's important right now is that we stick together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, there you are.</p>
<p>Who wants a pre-dinner snack? Oh! Oh, pumpkin, what's wrong? It's too embarrassing to talk about in front of the guys.</p>
<p>Know what I mean, girlfriend? Oh, sweetie.</p>
<p>Do you have your monthly shame? Do you wanna lie down in Elijah's room? Oh, I don't think that's gonna cut it.</p>
<p>I probably need to go home, call Dr. Collins.</p>
<p>It's that bad.</p>
<p>Oh, my sister-in-law's a gynecologist.</p>
<p>She's right in the other room.</p>
<p>There's no need to bother your doctor on a holiday.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>I'd like to tell you Annie avoided Shirley's doctor sister-in-law, but this ain't no fairy tale.</p>
<p>This is Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Let's see, what else? You've got some diabetes on my mother's side.</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>I like your hair.</p>
<p>The presence of it, I mean.</p>
<p>So I have a question.</p>
<p>It's been weighing on me pretty heavily.</p>
<p>At your age, in the bedroom --</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It's all good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Real good.</p>
<p>Look at them.</p>
<p>Bonding.</p>
<p>Probably laughing because I can't grow a beard.</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>Why don't we use these dinner rolls to do some role play? I see what I did there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This roll, this is me.</p>
<p>He's crying.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That's really good.</p>
<p>So, what do you do? I'm a lawyer who faked a bachelor's degree and practiced law for seven years before I got caught.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Like your hustle.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the summer I was Ralph Lauren in Saint-Tropez, '83.</p>
<p>I'm on a boat with-- Damn it, Willy.</p>
<p>I'm expressing.</p>
<p>Knock it off.</p>
<p>Why can't you just swallow it like any normal person? Oh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Oh! Right, like your new son.</p>
<p>Like mister-- Mr. I've-Got-My-Shirt-- I don't know personal details about you.</p>
<p>Well, my name's Jeff.</p>
<p>Don't help me, Mr. Helper-Guy.</p>
<p>First Mom dies, now this? Hey, she died 20 years ago, Willy.</p>
<p>He keeps singing the same old song.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>She died on you.</p>
<p>Here I thought you'd become Father of the Year, but you just got stuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, I don't have to tell you, I'm not a natural caretaker, but with Willy, you know, I checked all the boxes and he still turned out softer than wet cheese.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>He keeps saying he's gonna move out next week since '03.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I couldn't wait to get out.</p>
<p>I got my own place when I was 18.</p>
<p>I was the same way.</p>
<p>So who's ready to eat? Jeff, you care to carve the turkey? I knew it! You love him more than me.</p>
<p>I'll show you.</p>
<p>I'll run away.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>Hey, be my guest.</p>
<p>You run away, and I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, now, I'm sorry you guys had to see that, but maybe you could shrink his head, since you're here, for some reason.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I can do this.</p>
<p>Show me on the dinner roll where you're hurt! That's how it went for the afternoon.</p>
<p>This tag- team turkey day became our routine.</p>
<p>We endured the indignities as best we could.</p>
<p>Cousins fighting, complaints about the food, listening to a nephew do Borat for a full hour.</p>
<p>We figured out ways to steal away from time to time, saying we had to pee, had to get ice, had to do a Jewish thing in the other room.</p>
<p>I became known as the guy who could get you things.</p>
<p>Piece of gum, Playing cards, some novelty glasses I found in a box marked "crap." In those brief, tranquil moments, we felt human.</p>
<p>We felt free.</p>
<p>But sooner or la ter, our warden would come knocking.</p>
<p>Mostly, we just waited for our time to be served, but some didn't take kindly to waiting.</p>
<p>Some didn't have much time left.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>Amateur hour is over.</p>
<p>I'm going in there, pretend to break a hip, and we'll be sipping sambuca at Skeeper's in no time.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>He tripped on the rug.</p>
<p>Wait, now he's getting up.</p>
<p>He's walking around dazed like he's got a head injury.</p>
<p>Groin into the corner of the table.</p>
<p>This might actually work.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, why are people laughing? Let's see, I need a broom or a rake or two rakes.</p>
<p>Pierce, you were supposed to pretend to injure yourself so we could leave.</p>
<p>Leave? This is my <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Showtime at the Apollo</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240272'>It's Showtime at the Apollo</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1987&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Music</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>I'm killing out there.</p>
<p>Pierce was our last hope, or so we thought.</p>
<p>It seemed Troy Barnes had a plan.</p>
<p>What if we got sick? No.</p>
<p>No more faking illnesses.</p>
<p>Not fake sick.</p>
<p>Real sick.</p>
<p>And that's when I told my old firm to shove it.</p>
<p>I've always been more of a free agent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see that about you.</p>
<p>You seem like a self-made man.</p>
<p>Well, I kind of had to be.</p>
<p>Look, if it's okay with you, I'd like to break a rule.</p>
<p>I know we said no mushy stuff, but for what it's worth, I'm proud of you.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Makes you think, huh? Wait, what do you mean? Well, look, I mean, you've seen how Willy turned out.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven't done that kid any favors.</p>
<p>And so I look at you, so self-reliant and well-adjusted, and I think maybe I did something right.</p>
<p>You did something right? Well, let me say that different.</p>
<p>Uh, universe is a constantly expanding-- Stop.</p>
<p>I get the impulse.</p>
<p>Not gonna work.</p>
<p>No, I just mean that we are defined by what happens to us, and me leaving seems to have made you independent, made you strong.</p>
<p>With all due respect, which is none, go to hell.</p>
<p>So tunneling out is off the table? Who's hungry for turkey? Shirley, we were just-- About to-- Eat garbage dip.</p>
<p>Why did I have to go third? Look, I get it.</p>
<p>You wanna leave.</p>
<p>Shirley, we're sorry.</p>
<p>No, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>To be honest, I invited you as a bit of a buffer.</p>
<p>With Andre's family, I'm the butt of the joke.</p>
<p>With Andre gone this year, I thought I could tip the scales in my favor by having a few friends around.</p>
<p>That was wrong of me.</p>
<p>See you Monday.</p>
<p>I can't believe none of us noticed she was having such a hard time.</p>
<p>We can't leave.</p>
<p>Funny thing about prison.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person you thought was your warden turns out to be a prisoner, which doesn't line up with the Shawshank thing.</p>
<p>But maybe we've always been doing more of a Prison Break, the show.</p>
<p>Gah! What are you doing in my car? Take me with you.</p>
<p>Teach me what you know.</p>
<p>What in the cat's cradle is happening? Dad hates me.</p>
<p>What do you care what that guy thinks? He's a dick.</p>
<p>See? That's what I need to learn.</p>
<p>How to be all dead inside with muscles on top, not all emotional and flabby.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you are emotional.</p>
<p>If you pretend you're not, you're letting him off the hook for being terrible, which he is and always has been.</p>
<p>I mean, he meant the world to you, and you meant nothing to him, and if you run away now, he'll never know.</p>
<p>He should know.</p>
<p>Britta's the worst.</p>
<p>Ow! Jeez! Oh.</p>
<p>I thought you guys left.</p>
<p>We started as your buffer, but we're busting you out of here now.</p>
<p>I drew a map of your house on my stomach.</p>
<p>Uh, I know what my house looks like.</p>
<p>That's what I said.</p>
<p>If we act fast, we can get through this plan to put you in the trash can, take you out like trash.</p>
<p>But we gotta dress you like a baby.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing this, but I'm not going.</p>
<p>Those people up there, they may be rude, pushy.</p>
<p>They may have come to wrongheaded conclusions about <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Batman</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895'>Batman</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1989&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span></span></span></span> and Robin.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But they're my family.</p>
<p>Family means putting up with each other even when it's hard.</p>
<p>You guys can go.</p>
<p>I'll be fine.</p>
<p>Actually, we're gonna stay.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Family sticks it out.</p>
<p>That's ni-- Okay, full disclosure.</p>
<p>We're hiding out from that crazy white guy.</p>
<p>You came back.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You should take some credit for who I've become.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me tell you how I turned out just so you're crystal clear on your impact.</p>
<p>I am not well-adjusted.</p>
<p>More often than not, I am barely keeping it together.</p>
<p>I'm constantly texting, and there's no one at the other end.</p>
<p>I'm just a grown man who can't even look his own friends in the eye for too long because I'm afraid that they'll see that I am broken.</p>
<p>So you get credit for that.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, now-- One time, when I was in seventh grade, I told everybody at school that I had appendicitis.</p>
<p>I wanted someone to worry about me.</p>
<p>But when Beth Brannon asked to see the scar, I didn't wanna get found out, so I took Mom's scissors, and I made one.</p>
<p>It hurt like hell, but it was worth it, because I got 17 cards.</p>
<p>And I still keep them in a box underneath my bed 22 years later because it proves that someone, at some point, cared about me.</p>
<p>You wanna see the scar? So you get credit for that too.</p>
<p>This is me.</p>
<p>Look, Jeff, I, uh, Daddy! Are you faking a heart attack? Kind of a Hail Mary.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving, Dad.</p>
<p>Look, you're probably feeling a very strong urge to sleep with me right now, and that is normal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Britta, thank you.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>You're not gonna get all Jock Jams on me, are you? No, of course not.</p>
<p>I left my boom box at school.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>You gotta stop doing that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Come here, brother.</p>
<p>Come here, brother.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Why don't you save some for Christmas, buddy? And then Pierce did whiteface over blackface.</p>
<p>No one was amused.</p>
<p>It's meta.</p>
<p>Abed gets it.</p>
<p>So, Troy, how was your first real Thanksgiving? No offense to Shirley, but I don't see what the fuss is about.</p>
<p>Thanksgivings the war-- Oh.</p>
<p>I heard your Thanksgiving wasn't much better than mine.</p>
<p>So I thought we could take some time and be grateful for our real family.</p>
<p>The one we chose.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Sit, sit, sit.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Sit, sit, sit.</p>
<p>We never got to do a Shawshank homage.</p>
<p>Not the way I wanted to.</p>
<p>Maybe the hardest prisons to break out of are the ones without locks.</p>
<p>Wait, that doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>After that day, Jeff seemed like a man unburdened.</p>
<p>He told me about seeing his father, about how leaving there felt like breaking free of an emotional prison he'd been in.</p>
<p>Something about shackles on his heart.</p>
<p>To be honest, I stopped listening.</p>
<p>I was thinking about Christmas.</p>
<p>I hope we do Die Hard.</p>
<p>I hope it's in a restaurant.</p>
<p>I hope it lays out as cleanly as it does in my dreams.</p>
<p>I hope it's cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving, everyone, including you, dean.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Oh, I, my -- I'll have to remember this for next year.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p></p>
