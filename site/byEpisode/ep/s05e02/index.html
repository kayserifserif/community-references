<p>Hi, everybody.</p>

<p>Uhm Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>And this is Fundamentals of Law.</p>
<p>Any questions? You, Red Hair.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna learn names.</p>
<p>Will there be a syllabus? - "Will there be a syllabus?" Is good example of a question.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p>Ski Cap.</p>
<p>How are we gonna be graded? Oh, no spoilers, Ski Cap.</p>
<p>Maybe we better do names.</p>
<p>Dave.</p>
<p>What percent of our grade will the final be? Come on, guys, percentages, grades, that syllabus thing Are we human beings or just question-and-answer machines? We're students.</p>
<p>And you're a teacher.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm a teacher.</p>
<p>Did you see that? That teacher just leered at me.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>Hey, look, it's the star of "Head of the Ass." </p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard! Nice earring.</p>
<p>You look like the road manager for the California Raisins.</p>
<p>Whoa! What kind of teacher talks to a student like that? - Right? - Yeah.</p>
<p>Fresh meat, huh? - Yeah, Jeff Winger, law.</p>
<p>Buzz Hickey, criminology.</p>
<p>You can have that half of the office, but come spring, that corner is stacked to the rafters with fetal pigs.</p>
<p>I won't be here that long.</p>
<p>This is sort of a temporary gig for me.</p>
<p>Mm, I get it.</p>
<p>Teaching to make ends meet until a real job comes along -</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>How long have you been -</p>
<p>"Temporary gig."</p>
<p>Oh, I like you.</p>
<p>Oh, the new table turned out great, Abed.</p>
<p>Splendid varnishing.</p>
<p>"Table Mark II"? - I added that, and a few custom upgrades.</p>
<p>It's voice activated.</p>
<p>Table, resume table mode.</p>
<p>Huh? - Oh.</p>
<p>Table, power down.</p>
<p>Wait! I got a cup on there.</p>
<p>Oh, teacher man! - Ee! It's Professor Winger! Please don't razz me about being a teacher.</p>
<p>Teaching is the most noble profession in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, tell that to the guy that shares my office.</p>
<p>He fixes cuckoo clocks for fun.</p>
<p>That sounds like Mr. Hickey, my criminology professor.</p>
<p>I certainly hope you'll be a better teacher than him.</p>
<p>Annie, I don't know law.</p>
<p>I wasn't a real lawyer, remember? I can't just pretend I'm teaching.</p>
<p>I'm not Mythbusters.</p>
<p>There's a two-day course called "Nicolas Cage: Good or Bad." </p>
<p>I'm signing up.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to know.</p>

<p>Well, Jesus wasn't in 70 movies.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Cage class, sounds fun.</p>
<p>Jeff, you don't have time to take a blow-off class.</p>
<p>You need to figure out what you're gonna - teach your students.</p>
<p>Thanks, Annie, for one glorious second, I forgot I was a teacher.</p>
<p>Oh! Look at Mr. Smarty Pants!</p>
<p>I am so excited! Jeff is gonna help me save the school.</p>
<p>Not all by himself.</p>
<p>I am learning Excel.</p>
<p>Jeff, do you know Excel? - No.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like you do.</p>
<p>Yay, teaching!</p>
<p>I, as you know, am dramatic professor Sean Garrity, and you are now embarking on an odyssey of discussion about an actor who keeps the world asking: <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Nicolas Cage</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115'>Nicolas Cage</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094'>tt0119094</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295'>tt0399295</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113627'>tt0113627</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500'>tt0117500</a></span></span></span></span>, good or bad? Yes, young man? - So you don't know? - Mr. Nadir.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadir drove our TV Studies professor out of his mind by proving that there was an answer to the question "Who's the Boss?" - Angela.</p>
<p>I admire your brain, Mr. Nadir.</p>
<p>I did not admire Professor Sheffield, but I promise you, this question has no answer.</p>
<p>Your homework is to watch five <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Nicolas Cage</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115'>Nicolas Cage</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094'>tt0119094</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295'>tt0399295</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113627'>tt0113627</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500'>tt0117500</a></span></span></span></span> films by Wednesday, no marathons.</p>
<p>Space out your viewings.</p>
<p>Five, that's it? Be careful, Abed Nadir.</p>
<p>Promise me you will be careful.</p>
<p>I have no idea how to make a curriculum.</p>
<p>Becoming a teacher was a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Without a doubt.</p>
<p>That said, there are certain perks.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I didn't know teachers could cut in line.</p>
<p>I can actually experience this food warm and disgusting.</p>
<p>Winger, what are you doing? This line is for food, not for <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Lionel Richie</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005360'>Lionel Richie</a></span><span class='years'>1949&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>composer</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088939'>tt0088939</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082329'>tt0082329</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116'>tt0119116</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090319'>tt0090319</a></span></span></span></span> tickets.</p>
<p>This is my house.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>This man's name is Mr. Winger, and Mr. Winger is a teacher.</p>
<p>You know what that means? It means he gets your meatballs.</p>
<p>Ah, please.</p>
<p>That's all I have.</p>
<p>Get outta here.</p>
<p>Place is a zoo.</p>
<p>The trick is, you gotta show the other baboons you got a bigger, redder ass.</p>
<p>Let's hit the lounge.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Everybody, this is the new guy, Winger.</p>
<p>He's having trouble planning his curriculum.</p>
<p>What? Here's all you need to know Break into groups, grade each other's papers, and please enjoy the seven-disc edition of Planet Earth.</p>
<p>Yoo-hoo! Is there a Mr. Winger in here?</p>
<p>Jeffrey, we need to carve out some time to learn Excel.</p>
<p>Do you guys know Excel? I'm learning.</p>
<p>You know the rules, Pelton.</p>
<p>Drop the checks and move on.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I'm gonna boot up my computer and download the tutor - </p>
<p>What was that about? </p>
<p>Union rules.</p>
<p>Management's not allowed in the faculty lounge.</p>
<p>I could get used to this.</p>

<p>I mean, he seemed scared to smell that flower but happy to get shot.</p>
<p>He's a complex performer.</p>
<p>He'll give you The Rock, Con Air, then Face/Off, and you think you understand, but then Windtalkers, Guarding Tess, The Wicker Man.</p>
<p>He begs you to stop watching, but you can't.</p>
<p>That was an odd choice.</p>
<p>Would you say it was odd good or odd bad? Maybe he's just good in good movies and then acts crazy in crap to make drug money.</p>
<p>But is he good, or is he bad? Every actor is something.</p>

<p>There's a spectrum, and Cage is on it.</p>
<p>I just have to find him.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go check on Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff, how's the old curriculum going? Great.</p>
<p>Consider our nation's youth pre-inspired.</p>
<p>Want a refill, Winger? - Mm.</p>
<p>Is that Hickey? - Yeah.</p>
<p>We're working on syllabuses.</p>
<p>Hey, let's turd some lockers!</p>
<p>Gotta go! Teacher thing! It's "syllabi." </p>
<p>Guterman.</p>
<p>Droppin' mad science? Ooh, Elaine, take it easy on the Oxford commas.</p>
<p>Hey, walk, don't run, mister! This isn't a racetrack! Okay, dangerous minds, let's break into groups, discuss chapter one, and if you are lucky, we might sneak in a little Planet Earth.</p>
<p>Any questions? Ahem.</p>
<p>Just a few.</p>
<p>Ahh, she in your class, yo! So, I guess, uh, just read chapter one and memorize the federal rules of civil procedure.</p>
<p>Class dismissed.</p>
<p>Not so fast, Jeff.</p>
<p>I assume you know why I'm keeping you after class.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Ski Cap and White Dave got lots of stuff wrong too.</p>
<p>You're the teacher, Jeff.</p>
<p>You don't have to rub it in.</p>
<p>What I saw today was embarrassing.</p>
<p>You were late, you clearly had no idea Hey!</p>
<p>You had no idea what Tort Reform meant, and when I asked you to explain the Sixth Amendment, - you pled the Fifth! - I know my rights.</p>
<p>No, you don't.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>I gathered some materials.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, before class, I need to verify that you know enough to teach.</p>
<p>You're gonna quiz me? You're the worst.</p>
<p>I wish Troy was in my class instead of you! I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.</p>
<p>Hey, wait, I warned you to separate these worlds.</p>
<p>She's lead, we're chalk.</p>
<p>She needs to be taken out.</p>
<p>Of your class.</p>
<p>I say minus her.</p>
<p>Minus her? - Give her A-minuses.</p>
<p>It'll drive her nuts, she'll drop.</p>
<p>She'll call me on it.</p>
<p>She'll report me.</p>
<p>Teachers don't have to explain minuses.</p>
<p>Why do you think we invented 'em? - She's my friend.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>You like the Leonard Meatballs? They added something special.</p>
<p>It's Leonard.</p>
<p>Come on, I'm just messing with you.</p>
<p>You done with your bit? I'd like my earring back.</p>
<p>Yeah? - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Go get your earring, you piece of human garbage.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Okay, hey, I have a working theory, and don't react until you've heard the whole thing.</p>
<p>If you watch closely, at the seven-minute mark in Snake Eyes, you'll notice the moment where an alien arm - could've come up and - Abed, this isn't worth it.</p>
<p>Maybe <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Nicolas Cage</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115'>Nicolas Cage</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094'>tt0119094</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295'>tt0399295</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113627'>tt0113627</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500'>tt0117500</a></span></span></span></span> is just crazy.</p>
<p>All actors are crazy, Annie.</p>
<p>Some crazy actors are good, some are bad, but none of them are neither.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as both, so which one is <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Nicolas Cage</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115'>Nicolas Cage</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094'>tt0119094</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295'>tt0399295</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113627'>tt0113627</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500'>tt0117500</a></span></span></span></span>, huh? Oh! Oh! Okay, so break into groups, and then, you guys quiz each other.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger, is that really the best use of our time? Seems like the value of having you here is I think my value as a teacher is to teach you how to learn.</p>
<p>I think you're telling us we should teach ourselves.</p>
<p>I don't think you're gonna learn if I tell you how to think.</p>
<p>I think if you tell us what you think, then we'll learn that.</p>
<p>I thought you should break into groups, but you failed to learn that, so your theory's invalid.</p>
<p>Ooh, snap.</p>
<p>Break into groups.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger, how did you do that? - Do what? - You won an argument - against Annie Edison.</p>
<p>You don't argue with Annie, Garrett, you let her argue with herself until she loses.</p>
<p>You can win by not arguing? - Yeah, Ski Cap.</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to argue has already lost, because they pick an argument to lose.</p>
<p>I mean, that's why I never lost a case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors beat themselves, because they d Here.</p>
<p>Because they draw a circle around something called "The Truth," and they say that everything outside it is a lie.</p>
<p>Annie, don't cry, you were right.</p>
<p>I actually might enjoy teaching.</p>
<p>I'm not crying because of you.</p>
<p>I got this from Professor Hickey.</p>
<p>What the hell? He gave you a dead rat? No, this is my witness intimidation project.</p>
<p>He gave me this.</p>
<p>A-minus.</p>
<p>I guess I overextended my schedule.</p>

<p>I think he's a genius.</p>
<p>I mean, he keeps getting hired for some reason, and it's not because of his hair.</p>
<p>I don't know, if I was in 70 films over 30 years, and I spent each one talking at random volumes, I might accidentally win an Oscar.</p>
<p>I think our opinions about pop culture are fed to us by machines designed to criminalize - human autonomy.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>

<p>Abed? Abed! That was brilliant.</p>
<p>You gave Annie an A-minus? How could you? What were you thinking? - Are you drawing a peanut? - It's a duck, and it's none of your concern, actually.</p>
<p>Are you trying to cartoon? Trying and succeeding.</p>
<p>State your business.</p>
<p>I want to know what kind of monster minuses the best student in his class.</p>
<p>I'm a monster? I was in the storm drain lair of the Black River Ripper.</p>
<p>I have seen human heads used for things other than heads, so best not be calling me a monster.</p>
<p>Okay, you're a bad teacher.</p>
<p>I got her off your back.</p>
<p>I was handling it.</p>
<p>Unlike you, I know how to engage my students.</p>
<p>I mean, I may not love teaching, but I did fool around with it today, and I may hook up with it again a few more times even if I do dump it right before Christmas.</p>
<p>We do not work for them.</p>
<p>Maybe we do.</p>
<p>That does not count as an argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, drawing ducks doesn't count as cartooning! It's one duck, his name is Jim, and publishers are interested! Miss Edison, good news.</p>
<p>I talked to Professor Hickey and it turns out your project was an "A." </p>
<p>You used your connections to change my grade? No, an A-minus means you actually earned an "A," but the teacher doesn't like you.</p>
<p>It's a secret faculty thing.</p>
<p>What? - Are you kidding? - Et tu, Brute? Am I using that right? I've been busting my butt for five years, and the whole thing comes down to a few old losers' petty insecurities? - Oligarchy! - Et tu, Brute! - We've got to tell people! - Mm.</p>
<p>Minuses are made up! It's riot time! Yeah! Ugh! Bring me their heads!</p>
<p>Pop pop!</p>
<p>Abed? I couldn't find you at school, so I got worried.</p>
<p>You're throwing away all your little movies, why? They have no value anymore.</p>
<p>Well, if you're looking for something to believe in, I know a skinny, little Hebrew handyman you could meet.</p>
<p>I'm not going to become Christian, Shirley, or a better Muslim.</p>
<p>This was my religion.</p>
<p>I thought the meaning of people was somewhere in here.</p>
<p>Then I looked inside <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Nicolas Cage</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115'>Nicolas Cage</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094'>tt0119094</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295'>tt0399295</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113627'>tt0113627</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500'>tt0117500</a></span></span></span></span> and I found a secret.</p>
<p>People are random and pointless.</p>
<p>Well, in my religion, the whole point is that you can't understand every little thing, and you know, there's a word for people who remind you that you're not God, and invite you to try a little harder.</p>

<p>I just have to find him.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go check on Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff, how's the old curriculum going? Great.</p>
<p>Consider our nation's youth pre-inspired.</p>
<p>Want a refill, Winger? - Mm.</p>
<p>Is that Hickey? - Yeah.</p>
<p>We're working on syllabuses.</p>
<p>Hey, let's turd some lockers!</p>
<p>Gotta go! Teacher thing! It's "syllabi." </p>
<p>Guterman.</p>
<p>Droppin' mad science? Ooh, Elaine, take it easy on the Oxford commas.</p>
<p>Hey, walk, don't run, mister! This isn't a racetrack! Okay, dangerous minds, let's break into groups, discuss chapter one, and if you are lucky, we might sneak in a little Planet Earth.</p>
<p>Any questions? Ahem.</p>
<p>Just a few.</p>
<p>Ahh, she in your class, yo! So, I guess, uh, just read chapter one and memorize the federal rules of civil procedure.</p>
<p>Class dismissed.</p>
<p>Not so fast, Jeff.</p>
<p>I assume you know why I'm keeping you after class.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Ski Cap and White Dave got lots of stuff wrong too.</p>
<p>You're the teacher, Jeff.</p>
<p>You don't have to rub it in.</p>
<p>What I saw today was embarrassing.</p>
<p>You were late, you clearly had no idea Hey!</p>
<p>You had no idea what Tort Reform meant, and when I asked you to explain the Sixth Amendment, - you pled the Fifth! - I know my rights.</p>
<p>No, you don't.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>I gathered some materials.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, before class, I need to verify that you know enough to teach.</p>
<p>You're gonna quiz me? You're the worst.</p>
<p>I wish Troy was in my class instead of you! I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.</p>
<p>Hey, wait, I warned you to separate these worlds.</p>
<p>She's lead, we're chalk.</p>
<p>She needs to be taken out.</p>
<p>Of your class.</p>
<p>I say minus her.</p>
<p>Minus her? - Give her A-minuses.</p>
<p>It'll drive her nuts, she'll drop.</p>
<p>She'll call me on it.</p>
<p>She'll report me.</p>
<p>Teachers don't have to explain minuses.</p>
<p>Why do you think we invented 'em? - She's my friend.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>You like the Leonard Meatballs? They added something special.</p>
<p>It's Leonard.</p>
<p>Come on, I'm just messing with you.</p>
<p>You done with your bit? I'd like my earring back.</p>
<p>Yeah? - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Go get your earring, you piece of human garbage.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Okay, hey, I have a working theory, and don't react until you've heard the whole thing.</p>
<p>If you watch closely, at the seven-minute mark in Snake Eyes, you'll notice the moment where an alien arm - could've come up and - Abed, this isn't worth it.</p>
<p>Maybe Nicolas Cage is just crazy.</p>
<p>All actors are crazy, Annie.</p>
<p>Some crazy actors are good, some are bad, but none of them are neither.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as both, so which one is Nicolas Cage, huh? Oh! Oh! Okay, so break into groups, and then, you guys quiz each other.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger, is that really the best use of our time? Seems like the value of having you here is I think my value as a teacher is to teach you how to learn.</p>
<p>I think you're telling us we should teach ourselves.</p>
<p>I don't think you're gonna learn if I tell you how to think.</p>
<p>I think if you tell us what you think, then we'll learn that.</p>
<p>I thought you should break into groups, but you failed to learn that, so your theory's invalid.</p>
<p>Ooh, snap.</p>
<p>Break into groups.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger, how did you do that? - Do what? - You won an argument - against Annie Edison.</p>
<p>You don't argue with Annie, Garrett, you let her argue with herself until she loses.</p>
<p>You can win by not arguing? - Yeah, Ski Cap.</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to argue has already lost, because they pick an argument to lose.</p>
<p>I mean, that's why I never lost a case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors beat themselves, because they d Here.</p>
<p>Because they draw a circle around something called "The Truth," and they say that everything outside it is a lie.</p>
<p>Annie, don't cry, you were right.</p>
<p>I actually might enjoy teaching.</p>
<p>I'm not crying because of you.</p>
<p>I got this from Professor Hickey.</p>
<p>What the hell? He gave you a dead rat? No, this is my witness intimidation project.</p>
<p>He gave me this.</p>
<p>A-minus.</p>
<p>I guess I overextended my schedule.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Jeff.</p>
<p>I have to drop your class.</p>
<p>Okay, thoughts on Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>I think he's a genius.</p>
<p>I mean, he keeps getting hired for some reason, and it's not because of his hair.</p>

<p>He begs you to stop watching, but you can't.</p>
<p>That was an odd choice.</p>
<p>Would you say it was odd good or odd bad? Maybe he's just good in good movies and then acts crazy in crap to make drug money.</p>
<p>But is he good, or is he bad? Every actor is something.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr., good, Jim Belushi, bad.</p>
<p>Van Damme, the good kind of bad, Johnny Depp, the bad kind of good.</p>

<p>I got this from Professor Hickey.</p>
<p>What the hell? He gave you a dead rat? No, this is my witness intimidation project.</p>
<p>He gave me this.</p>
<p>A-minus.</p>
<p>I guess I overextended my schedule.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Jeff.</p>
<p>I have to drop your class.</p>
<p>Okay, thoughts on Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>I think he's a genius.</p>
<p>I mean, he keeps getting hired for some reason, and it's not because of his hair.</p>
<p>I don't know, if I was in 70 films over 30 years, and I spent each one talking at random volumes, I might accidentally win an Oscar.</p>
<p>I think our opinions about pop culture are fed to us by machines designed to criminalize - human autonomy.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>Dear God.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>No, stand back.</p>
<p>Give him space.</p>
<p>Nicolas Cage, good or bad.</p>
<p>A challenge, certainly, but not unsolvable, because all actors have distinct values, which I use to find answers.</p>
<p>Abed, how much Nicolas Cage did you -</p>
<p>Enough! I watched enough to find the answers.</p>
<p>Because this this is my reality, this is how I learned to be, and my being doesn't allow for Nicolas freaking Cage, okay? Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm a cat.</p>
<p>I'm a sexy cat.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Oh! O-o-ohh! Abed? Think of something safe like Holly Hunter, or Don Cheadle!</p>
<p>Abed? Abed! That was brilliant.</p>
<p>You gave Annie an A-minus? How could you? What were you thinking? - Are you drawing a peanut? - It's a duck, and it's none of your concern, actually.</p>
<p>Are you trying to cartoon? Trying and succeeding.</p>
<p>State your business.</p>
<p>I want to know what kind of monster minuses the best student in his class.</p>
<p>I'm a monster? I was in the storm drain lair of the Black River Ripper.</p>
<p>I have seen human heads used for things other than heads, so best not be calling me a monster.</p>
<p>Okay, you're a bad teacher.</p>
<p>I got her off your back.</p>
<p>I was handling it.</p>
<p>Unlike you, I know how to engage my students.</p>
<p>I mean, I may not love teaching, but I did fool around with it today, and I may hook up with it again a few more times even if I do dump it right before Christmas.</p>
<p>We do not work for them.</p>
<p>Maybe we do.</p>
<p>That does not count as an argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, drawing ducks doesn't count as cartooning! It's one duck, his name is Jim, and publishers are interested! Miss Edison, good news.</p>
<p>I talked to Professor Hickey and it turns out your project was an "A." </p>
<p>You used your connections to change my grade? No, an A-minus means you actually earned an "A," but the teacher doesn't like you.</p>
<p>It's a secret faculty thing.</p>
<p>What? - Are you kidding? - Et tu, Brute? Am I using that right? I've been busting my butt for five years, and the whole thing comes down to a few old losers' petty insecurities? - Oligarchy! - Et tu, Brute! - We've got to tell people! - Mm.</p>
<p>Minuses are made up! It's riot time! Yeah! Ugh! Bring me their heads!</p>
<p>Pop pop!</p>
<p>Abed? I couldn't find you at school, so I got worried.</p>
<p>You're throwing away all your little movies, why? They have no value anymore.</p>
<p>Well, if you're looking for something to believe in, I know a skinny, little Hebrew handyman you could meet.</p>
<p>I'm not going to become Christian, Shirley, or a better Muslim.</p>
<p>This was my religion.</p>
<p>I thought the meaning of people was somewhere in here.</p>
<p>Then I looked inside Nicolas Cage and I found a secret.</p>
<p>People are random and pointless.</p>
<p>Well, in my religion, the whole point is that you can't understand every little thing, and you know, there's a word for people who remind you that you're not God, and invite you to try a little harder.</p>
<p>Prophets, messiahs, kung fu pandas.</p>
<p>So Nicolas Cage is Jesus? - Uh, no, but he clearly works in mysterious ways, and maybe that's just his job.</p>
<p>And that's why critics can call him a genius or an idiot and be right no matter what.</p>
<p>A demon to some and an angel to others, like a cenobite.</p>
<p>Excuse me, did you say cenobite? Yeah, you know, cenobite, like from He<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hellraiser</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093177'>Hellraiser</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1987&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>You like He<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hellraiser</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093177'>Hellraiser</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1987&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>You know the word "He<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hellraiser</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093177'>Hellraiser</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1987&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span> I thought pinhead in space was a bit of a letdown, but I'm in for the ride.</p>
<p>Rise up, Greendale! Your teachers have been lying to you! You deserve slightly higher grades! ALL: Slightly higher grades! Slightly higher grades! The whole world is watching this! - Yeah! - Oh, wait.</p>
<p>I'm out of data minutes.</p>
<p>The whole world will be watching this on the first of next month! ALL: Slightly higher grades! Slightly higher grades! - Jeffrey, do something! - Slightly higher grades.</p>
<p>Distract them.</p>
<p>Take your shirt off! - Here.</p>
<p>ALL: Slightly higher grades! - Slightly higher grades! - Everybody, calm down! Just listen! Do you think the students and teachers at Harvard are at each other's throats? No, because they're all rich.</p>
<p>We all have something in common too.</p>
<p>We all suck.</p>
<p>We're all broke.</p>
<p>We all just went through an entire week of meatball lunches without even blinking.</p>
<p>Oh, that's on me.</p>
<p>I converted the lunch menu to a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The teachers here are teachers here because they did something wrong, same as the students.</p>
<p>So get on the same team, because, take it from me, those of us that get to leave aren't going anywhere.</p>
<p>ALL: Boo! - No, you suck!</p>
<p>Ugh! Jeffrey, go with my "take off your shirt" plan! May I point out that you're doing this together? It's all based on rows and columns of cells.</p>
<p>I think that's why the call it "Excel." </p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Mm-kay, now, I know it's unrealistic to think that we can eliminate riots completely, but I have been crunching the numbers, and I believe we can reduce them by 40%.</p>
<p>Let's hope the man doesn't target you - for dreaming this big.</p>
<p>Here's my plan.</p>
<p>You know that "Save Greendale" committee you pretended to form? We need one of those for real.</p>
<p>I want a student/teacher alliance, with you in charge.</p>
<p>I vote myself out.</p>
<p>You don't have a quorum.</p>
<p>And don't forget, if I fire you, you're likely starve and die, so you know.</p>
<p>Do you want me to cut your meatball?</p>
<p>All right, look, there are two things I don't do well, apologies and drawing duck bills.</p>
<p>I lost perspective.</p>
<p>Students aren't the enemy, and, I don't know, maybe my bills are a little pointy.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm basing them on beaks.</p>
<p>Apologize to Annie.</p>
<p>I did, I gave her an "A." </p>
<p>I don't know how else to make it right.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I guess, I don't know, I quit.</p>
<p>I got a better idea.</p>
<p>As our first order of business for the student/teacher Save Greendale Committee, we hereby ban the Dean from attending future meetings.</p>
<p>ALL: Yeah.</p>
<p>Our second order of business - Lunch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm taste-testing rations for the shelter I'm digging.</p>
<p>Are you the coolest person in the world? I doubt it.</p>
<p>I would like to address the fact that there are no Asian-Americans represented here.</p>
<p>We can get Chang.</p>
<p>No need to rush into anything, I just wanted to address it.</p>
<p>Anybody want some nuts? __ __ __ __ __ - Quiet, I think he's just coming.</p>
<p>This is gonna be hilarious.</p>
<p>Yeah, pharmacy please.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Buzz Hickey.</p>
<p>I think you gave me the wrong medication.</p>
<p>I usually get Lipitor.</p>
<p>What do you mean my insurance won't cover it anymore? My body doesn't respond well to the generic stuff.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question, lady, can you pay out of pocket? I'm an educator, ma'am, living on a teacher's salary! No, I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p>What's your name? Leia, well, let me tell you something, Leia, I wake up every night screaming.</p>
<p>Life is unfair, but it's the only thing we g Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll call back later.</p>
<p>Mom, it's Buzz.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say this as fast as I can.</p>
<p>We can't afford to bury dad with the rest of the family.</p>
