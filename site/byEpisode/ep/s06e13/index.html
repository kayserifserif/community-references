<p>School's out, bitches.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Greendale students! We've pulled off another year and we're still standing.</p>
<p>Take that, health inspector, building inspector, foundation inspector, water line inspector, geologist, exterminator, plumber, and dad.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Whoo hoo.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Why bring a metronome? I thought the sound might accentuate the anxious idleness of our last meeting's final seconds.</p>
<p>Good job, bad idea.</p>
<p>Okay, that is done.</p>
<p>Yeah! Yay! There's more! This one is exciting.</p>
<p>We have to rename the Save Greendale committee, due to the fact that Greendale is done being saved! You think that's more exciting than summer? Oh, am I stealing your rays, dude? Come on, it's neat! Our mission is finally accomplished, once and for all, so what do we call ourselves now? The accomplishers.</p>
<p>The obsoletists.</p>
<p>Steven King's dreamcatchers.</p>
<p>Susan.</p>
<p>You guys are rebelling against yourselves.</p>
<p>You get that, right? The current trend in branding is unique, simplistic, phonetically memorable gibberish.</p>
<p>How about nipple dippers? I like nipple dippers.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You guys.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ooh, nippledippers.</p>
<p>com is available.</p>
<p>Grab that mother.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Nipple dippers, listen up.</p>
<p>Text from the dean.</p>
<p>Don't leave yet, I'm almost there.</p>
<p>Special celebration.</p>
<p>Just finished entire semester without wearing a single silly outfit.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I didn't even notice.</p>
<p>Good for him.</p>
<p>Oh, oh.</p>
<p>Hey everybody! I made it! Obviously, I binged pretty hard there after the bell rang but, I made it! Are you guys going out to celebrate or something? Maybe I'll tag along, it's been a tough year, I could use a drink.</p>
<p>We were gonna to Britta's bar whenever - Oh.</p>
<p>Mother time is willing to call it a year.</p>
<p>Kay fine, we're done, happy summer.</p>
<p>Nipple dippers drink for free! I'll pay for my drinks, I'm not acknowledging that title.</p>
<p>Someone owes me ten bucks for the domain.</p>
<p>I won't be able to join you.</p>
<p>I gotta get on the road to California.</p>
<p>I got a job through LinkedIn.</p>
<p>What? That's crazy! People use LinkedIn? No, LinkedIn hired me to help figure out why people don't use it.</p>
<p>Also, I have an old lady friend I went to high school with who just became un-married last week and I thought I'd look her up.</p>
<p>Wow, you work fast.</p>
<p>Or actually, very slow.</p>
<p>Either way, good luck.</p>
<p>Are you coming back Elroy? I think so.</p>
<p>Probably, maybe.</p>
<p>Have a great summer.</p>
<p>Woah! You guys think bars scene always have to start at a billiards shot? Or do you think every time someone takes a shot a in billiards they start a new bar scene without knowing it? What? You can just say shut up Abed.</p>
<p>Okay, ask me if I'm coming back? Are you coming back? Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I mean what was that, right? That was an Irish goodbye.</p>
<p>Let's give it an Irish wake.</p>
<p>Six years guys.</p>
<p>Nipple dippers.</p>
<p>Nipple dippers.</p>
<p>Where's Annie? I mean no offense to you guys but she's the only one that gets me.</p>
<p>She said she had an interview? Six years.</p>
<p>Six seasons, right Abed? Don't put a nickel in him.</p>
<p>Stop mitigating everyone.</p>
<p>So Abed, what happens in season seven? Oh, man.</p>
<p>I don't know how likely season seven is.</p>
<p>I mean, what show ever peaks after season six? Simpsons, Seinfeld, South Park, Friends.</p>
<p>Those shows weren't hemorrhaging characters every year.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't like that word, hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>I'll see what I can do.</p>
<p>What if Shirley came back, would that change your disposition? Shirley could get us back on formula, but I don't see it turning us around.</p>
<p>Sorry, what's our formula? Well, basically.</p>
<p>I have a placeholder so set up it, makes analogies look like punchlines.</p>
<p>My setup lacks awareness, but my punchline doesn't know.</p>
<p>Abusively cynical one liner dismissing everything you just said.</p>
<p>Absurd reaction.</p>
<p>You guys, can we put a pin in the B story and focus on the A story? I don't trust A stories.</p>
<p>Never have, never will.</p>
<p>I had a set up about a story that was so placeholder, the punchline came five words early.</p>
<p>And I can tag it too.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I'll just take a moment to explain the risks involved in all decisions made from here until eternity.</p>
<p>Who the hell are you? I'm Frankie Dart.</p>
<p>Is this combination gonna work? Not my place to say.</p>
<p>Abed? Lizard.</p>
<p>Fire hydrant.</p>
<p>Obama.</p>
<p>Shane! You know, I put time into what I do wardrobe wise.</p>
<p>Yeah see, Shirley, no Shirley, what does it matter, right? Abed, we're not formulas, and if I had no self-awareness, I think I'd know.</p>
<p>Things have a certain structure to them, you know? If we stray from it, we're weird, if we stick to it, we're boring.</p>
<p>Yeah, but isn't that more about the shape of your brain, Abed? I mean, no offense or anything.</p>
<p>But isn't the shape of your brain kinda fucked up? Hm.</p>
<p>What's your season seven pitch? My pitch for your fall semester at Greendale is that everyone is nice and has fun and grows together.</p>
<p>Shirley or Elroy? See, that's racist, man.</p>
<p>Shirley or Elroy? That's racist.</p>
<p>How about they both come back? How about there's a whole third black person? Where do they all sit? They well they sit wherever they want to sit, as of the 1960s.</p>
<p>They sit.</p>
<p>They sit.</p>
<p>Just pitch it.</p>
<p>Don't pitch it.</p>
<p>I'm pitching it.</p>
<p>Guess what? I made something.</p>
<p>I made a belt with fabric.</p>
<p>How cute is that? Well, I think that's very cute, so oh, and I love you guys.</p>
<p>I've got, I'm angry and you should vote or don't vote.</p>
<p>Sweet! Hallelujah! These are good times, baby.</p>
<p>Good times girl, good times.</p>
<p>Hey, I thought of something.</p>
<p>You know, we should go to the to the to the, to to the market.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should.</p>
<p>Well, wouldn't that be like a thing we saw, and didn't we do that? So shouldn't we be more ashamed and clever? And make everything more difficult? Yes, and I think we should be deeply sad.</p>
<p>And I'm nuts.</p>
<p>But I'm happy.</p>
<p>And I'm happy too.</p>
<p>And you know, hallelujah, and church, and singing, and street wisdom.</p>
<p>Stop! Crazy, and racist, and terrible! I agree.</p>
<p>You're being way too linear about this.</p>
<p>Shirley, Elroy, Troy, Hickey, living in the past.</p>
<p>Season seven don't need no past.</p>
<p>What are you pitching? Don't pitch! This is my pitch.</p>
<p>All right, that includes all notes and business as it pertains to the files.</p>
<p>How are you guys doing? Babe, how you doing, girl? I'm cool, it's all good.</p>
<p>Annie, you're looking fine.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, what about me? Hey everybody, look at me! I'm ice cube head! I've got an ice cube for a head.</p>
<p>I also eat cell phones, so you better be careful with those cellphones about me, because they taste like prime rib where I'm from.</p>
<p>Oh ho ho, boy.</p>
<p>Imagine the times we'll all get in together, especially when I use my powers to help solve all your problems.</p>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa, it's getting crazy in here! All right, I'm going home.</p>
<p>What? Guys, we just finished year six, and it was hard work.</p>
<p>And I don't really care about Greendale.</p>
<p>And I don't wanna spend my brief moment of humanity doing conceptual riffs, developing the imaginary TV show of our lives.</p>
<p>By the way, terrible improv.</p>
<p>Ice cube head? You were just looking at your drink.</p>
<p>Busted.</p>
<p>Annie? I got the internship.</p>
<p>I got the internship! I'm gonna intern for the FBI.</p>
<p>I'll leave in a week.</p>
<p>I'll be in DC all summer.</p>
<p>You're leaving the nest.</p>
<p>Can I have your bedroom? If you don't come back, if you don't come back.</p>
<p>Well, I'm definitely coming back, probably.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>Okay, next order of business.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger, Garrett's holding Leonard's hand again.</p>
<p>Garrett, stop doing that.</p>
<p>I'm checking for a pulse.</p>
<p>Say, hands off the Leonard dice.</p>
<p>Question, when can we start the next paintball game? I don't think he can force it.</p>
<p>Lots of things can be forced, like a human head through a six-inch drain pipe.</p>
<p>What? Just kidding, pal.</p>
<p>Okay, did anyone on the sustained Greendale committee do any of their assignments this week.</p>
<p>Scrunch.</p>
<p>Sorry, bro.</p>
<p>I don't work for you.</p>
<p>You work for me.</p>
<p>I'm the tech billionaire that bought this dump and cuts your paycheck.</p>
<p>If you can call that a paycheck.</p>
<p>I've seen more zeroes over Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of them.</p>
<p>The sky was black with smoke bombs.</p>
<p>Double click this, Winger.</p>
<p>It's your job to work.</p>
<p>It is our job to party.</p>
<p>And hatch harebrained schemes.</p>
<p>And get laid.</p>
<p>And get laid.</p>
<p>And eventually leave you here as well.</p>
<p>Jeff, you okay? Huh? Oh, I, I was taken aback.</p>
<p>It's big news.</p>
<p>What have you guys been doing? We were just looking for ways to make season seven work.</p>
<p>I mean we've got through six seasons.</p>
<p>I mean what's up with that? Where's season seven? I mean we gotta figure out season seven.</p>
<p>Or maybe we could just hang out.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>Last night was so insane, it made the insane clown posse look like the well-adjusted clown posse.</p>
<p>It must be hard work running away from your own age.</p>
<p>Has anyone seen my e-cigarette? There should be a charity for people like you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I don't know if can keep making the commute from here to the FBI headquarters.</p>
<p>Britta, Abed, I'll have to move back in.</p>
<p>I moved in with them.</p>
<p>Chang, we have files.</p>
<p>Moving out.</p>
<p>You seem stressed, Annie.</p>
<p>Are those last few criminology credits you need hard to get at Greendale? Please.</p>
<p>The only credit that it's hard to get at Greendale is from a bank.</p>
<p>It's just, they have schools for this kind of stuff at Quantico.</p>
<p>Being with you guys is great, but why is this a good choice for me? Why doesn't the audience feel sorry for me? Britta, your parents have been murdered.</p>
<p>By whom? The police won't touch it.</p>
<p>They're calling it a double suicide.</p>
<p>Britta, I got this.</p>
<p>You're proposing a version of the show in which Annie comes back, and it hinges on the murder of my parents.</p>
<p>It's a placeholder.</p>
<p>I'm just saying there's always gonna be a need for law at Greendale.</p>
<p>You remember the ass crack bandit? Do I remember? I mean.</p>
<p>Doesn't everybody.</p>
<p>Could have been anybody.</p>
<p>What is with this diaper thing? Is it about shaming me? Do you really want a bunch of people dressing you? It would be polite to try.</p>
<p>It's nice to see you interested in this stuff, Jeff, but I wouldn't watch that season.</p>
<p>Me, neither.</p>
<p>You wanna know a perfect season seven? I can't count the reasons I should stay.</p>
<p>One by one, they all just fade away.</p>
<p>Well, guess what Senator? You were allowed to call us terrorists before we moved to international waters, but we're a nation now.</p>
<p>So I guess this is fucking war.</p>
<p>Annie, I'm gonna need you to go to Washington.</p>
<p>I'm scared.</p>
<p>Be more scared than that.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>The protesters are scared.</p>
<p>They need you to talk to them.</p>
<p>They should be scared, but they shouldn't need a leader to tell them what to do.</p>
<p>We're all born free into a world of lies.</p>
<p>But let's talk about you for a second, though.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not a joke anymore.</p>
<p>I'm strictly transgender.</p>
<p>I'm not all this other stuff.</p>
<p>I represent the transgender community, and it's a real thing.</p>
<p>I am not crazy, but I do have flaws.</p>
<p>I'm smart.</p>
<p>All this other stuff, glad to be of service, Britta.</p>
<p>I want my diaper back.</p>
<p>I don't even own a TV and I wouldn't watch that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, what's your pitch? Oh, well, I, I mean, it's not that complicated is it? Hello.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>How's everyone? Hello.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>We could learn about science or history it's set in a school, after all.</p>
<p>Why aren't we learning? And I know that's not enough, so.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>It's possible there is more skill to it than I thought.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>There is skill to it.</p>
<p>More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun.</p>
<p>TV defeats it's own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.</p>
<p>It's TV, it's comfort.</p>
<p>It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day.</p>
<p>And it needs to be okay for it to get on a boat with Levar Burton and never come back.</p>
<p>Because eventually, it all will.</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's not just that.</p>
<p>It's just such a classic mistake but.</p>
<p>I got really attached to my pitch.</p>
<p>I had a sound track in my head and everything.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with Abed.</p>
<p>And I have an effortless pitch.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>So, how's this semesters crop of apples looking? Britta's been out rotting.</p>
<p>Asian kid in my math class, doesn't want to study because he doesn't want to be a stereotype.</p>
<p>It's pretty funny.</p>
<p>Sounds like a strong B story.</p>
<p>And I can say that without throwing anyone because I teach TV appreciation.</p>
<p>Chang you can send that student to me and we'll make it more serious.</p>
<p>I'm the school shrink I can wear these glasses every episode.</p>
<p>You are super hot in them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very hot.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>This gives me a more solid reason to interact with you than a stupid committee.</p>
<p>By the way I'm a lesbian.</p>
<p>That's why I haven't hit on Jeff.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Here's my deal, I teach criminology.</p>
<p>But look, it's the original Annie.</p>
<p>But I'm grown up and I'm hot, but not little girl hot.</p>
<p>And I'm happy and we're all together and it makes sense.</p>
<p>We just might live the good life yet.</p>
<p>Hi! Dean! Dean, I told you not to come into the teachers lounge, you're supposed to be in dean class.</p>
<p>How can I learn to be dean if I can't hang out with teachers? We're supposed to be shaping minds, but we keep shaping each other.</p>
<p>Bring it in.</p>
<p>In this version, will you tell me what to do a lot? Am I on meds in it? I'm mellow and relatable.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I would love to teach at Greendale, and I do miss wearing skirts.</p>
<p>Why don't you shallow a horse pill size contrivance, it would open up new areas and dynamics.</p>
<p>And it's evergreen.</p>
<p>Well great that's settled.</p>
<p>How do we make it real? Annie, maybe you should start looking into education classes.</p>
<p>You too, Abed.</p>
<p>Well, I should probably tell you guys that I'm moving to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>What? Yeah, like a real TV executive I was letting you guys work your ass off, because there's no profit in saying no to an idea, but now that it's time for me to commit I have to pass.</p>
<p>I got a job as a PA on a Fox show, it's in a video game studio.</p>
<p>It's like 30 Rock, meets IT Crowd, meets, well me, I'm growin' up That's so great Abed.</p>
<p>Congratulations Abed.</p>
<p>I'm so happy for you.</p>
<p>But you're coming back right? Maybe.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>That's six seasons and a movie.</p>
<p>Jeff, I know it comforts you to look at things through that meta lens, but this is reality.</p>
<p>TV's rules aren't based on common sense.</p>
<p>They're based on the studio wanting to milk their properties dry.</p>
<p>Here here.</p>
<p>Cheers to that and cheers to Abed.</p>
<p>Cheers! What, Jeffrey? Hey.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Annie, I'm home.</p>
<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>How was your day? Did anything funny happen? Who cares.</p>
<p>How was your day? Good.</p>
<p>Sebastian did some drawing.</p>
<p>Sebastian? Let's look at them.</p>
<p>Sebastian.</p>
<p>Sebastian.</p>
<p>Back to your child area.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Are you okay? Is this really what you want? Of course.</p>
<p>I mean, I'd be fine with a dog too.</p>
<p>But, whatever you want.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what I want? Yes.</p>
<p>How'd you get in here? I pulled the spare key so the dean would stop leaving them under the welcome mat.</p>
<p>You left weirdly.</p>
<p>Well, there's no normal way to do anything now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're gonna be fine, you know.</p>
<p>I don't wanna be fine.</p>
<p>I wanna be 25 and heading out into the world.</p>
<p>I wanna fall asleep on a beach and be able to walk the next day, or stay up all night on accident.</p>
<p>I wanna wear a t-shirt without looking like I forgot to get dressed.</p>
<p>I want to be terrified of AIDS, I want to have an opinion about those, boring ass Marvel movies.</p>
<p>And I want those opinions to be of any concern to the people making them.</p>
<p>Well, I want to live in the same home for more than a year, order wine without feeling nervous, have a resume full of crazy mistakes instead of crazy lies.</p>
<p>I want stories and wisdom, perspective.</p>
<p>I wanna have so much behind me I'm not a slave to what's in front of me, especially these flavorless unremarkable Marvel movie.</p>
<p>They are so not a big deal! I know! It's just all there is! Yes, and you get to say that! I could screw myself if I say it, but there's pressures on me you don't have to live under, if you accept that you're older.</p>
<p>And let the kid stuff go.</p>
<p>I let you go, Annie.</p>
<p>From my hands and my head.</p>
<p>The heart, which cynics say is code for penis, wants what it wants.</p>
<p>But I let you go.</p>
<p>The others are coming.</p>
<p>I think you should kiss me goodbye or you might regret it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>What about you? Oh, I'll regret the kiss for a week, I'm in my 20s.</p>
<p>Who cares? Are we interrupting? Stop being gross! Are you guys doing an unauthorized finale in here? Not cool.</p>
<p>Abed, I know it gives you comfort to see everything through that metal lens, but we were just saying goodbye to the room.</p>
<p>For season six.</p>
<p>Season seven, who knows? It's out of our hands.</p>
<p>Too many variables.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>That was one cool for each season.</p>
<p>Wait, do it again.</p>
<p>I want to try something.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Cool, cool.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Cool, cool.</p>
<p>I farted during the fourth one.</p>
<p>It's an inside joke.</p>
<p>I'm gonna miss you guys.</p>
<p>Gay.</p>
<p>You know what I think everybody should do, as a humble outsider that came in and nailed it? I think everyone should imagine their own personal version of season seven and not share it with anyone.</p>
<p>And then maybe it'll come true.</p>
<p>No cutting to any of them.</p>
<p>If you cut to it, it won't come true.</p>
<p>You just stopped being a study group.</p>
<p>I hereby pronounce you a community.</p>
<p>Brianna, you're the driven idealist.</p>
<p>Kaylee, you're the fiery passionate one.</p>
<p>We might have a fun no strings and Mackenzie, the kooky nerdy one, and Hailey, the other nerdy one! You guys should be best friends and have pillow fights.</p>
<p>And there's Phoebe, the wise one.</p>
<p>No? You're nerdy too? Okay, and the rest of you are the redhead ones.</p>
<p>And we're gonna have some pretty crazy times, and eventually you'll leave and be replaced by new ones.</p>
<p>And that's something I'm equipped to handle now.</p>
<p>I'm sort of the hero that way.</p>
<p>We can cut to them at home though, right? I mean by ourselves? Sure.</p>
<p>I love that I got to be with you guys.</p>
<p>Gay.</p>
<p>You saved my life, and changed it forever.</p>
<p>Gay! Thank you.</p>
<p>I'm gay.</p>
<p>I'm for real gay.</p>
<p>I'm legit gay! Oh, there's a river that winds on forever I'm gonna see where it leads.</p>
<p>Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted I'm gonna stand on the peak.</p>
<p>Out there's a land that time don't command.</p>
<p>Wanna be the first to arrive.</p>
<p>No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin.</p>
<p>Nowhere the buses lay.</p>
<p>To the ends, to the ends would you follow me? There's a world that was meant for us to see.</p>
<p>To the ends of the earth would you follow me? This is the show.</p>
<p>Right, that's right.</p>
<p>Community! The hit show is now a hit board game.</p>
<p>More like an I'm bored game.</p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard.</p>
<p>You look like a German puppet maker and smell like the inside of a church.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah commercial video describing the rules of gameplay.</p>
<p>I like you, Leonard.</p>
<p>As a friend.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Sorry Britta, but that friendship just got a benefit.</p>
<p>Collect all the other players' identities and be the first to figure out if the game is part of the show or, I got it.</p>
<p>The whole show is happening inside this game.</p>
<p>Then explain this.</p>
<p>What is it? It's a script of a fake commercial at the end of season six, starring this family.</p>
<p>Sorry, dad.</p>
<p>Guess I win.</p>
<p>You stupid child.</p>
<p>Nobody's winning anything.</p>
<p>Don't you see? This means we don't exist.</p>
<p>We're not created by God, we're created by a joke.</p>
<p>We were never born, and we will never actually live.</p>
<p>Dice not included.</p>
<p>Some assembly required.</p>
<p>Lines between perception, desire, and reality may become blurred, redundant, or interchangeable.</p>
<p>Characters may hook up with no regard for your emotional investment.</p>
<p>Some episodes too conceptual to be funny.</p>
<p>Some too funny to be immersive, and some so immersive they still aren't funny.</p>
<p>Consistency between seasons may vary.</p>
<p>Viewers may be measured by a secretive obsolete system based on selected participants keeping handwritten journals of what they watch.</p>
<p>Show may be cancelled and moved to the Internet, where it turns out tens of millions were watching the whole time, may not matter.</p>
<p>Fake commercial may end with disclaimer gag which may descend into vain Chuck Lorre-esque rant by narcissistic creator.</p>
<p>Creator may be unstable.</p>
<p>Therapist may have told creator this is not how you make yourself a good person.</p>
<p>Life may pass by while we ignore or mistreat those close to us.</p>
