<p>Ready for the Bus Driver, Winger? Know why they call me Bus Driver? You've been traveling? Because I'm taking your butt to school.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Cool, I'm up.</p>
<p>No, game's to 15.</p>
<p>Since when? Since you scored 11.</p>
<p>Sorry, Abed, I have to finish kicking Troy's butt.</p>
<p>All that angry talk about butts.</p>
<p>Kick your butt, stomp your butt, punch your butt.</p>
<p>Do they say "punch your butt"? Point is, hatred of each other's butts.</p>
<p>Men play sports so they can seek out and destroy their own sensitivity.</p>
<p>Oh, I never thought about it that way.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Think we'll learn that in our women's studies class? Hell, no.</p>
<p>We're gonna find our roots in that class and stop defining our gender by theirs.</p>
<p>It will be nice to get away from the boys and take a class with just us.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Or a-women.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Am I right? Bring it in for a boob bump, ladies.</p>
<p>Uh --</p>
<p>No? We'll get there.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Remember those remote control cars and you thought you were real cool? Well, it turns out you're not.</p>
<p>DraganFlyer, beyotch.</p>
<p>Yep, four propellers.</p>
<p>It's got a built-in spy cam.</p>
<p>Range, 100 yards, and it will strangle your stupid cars' little butts.</p>
<p>Pierce, we're in a game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we're really not into RC anymore.</p>
<p>What? But that's a DraganFlyer.</p>
<p>Come on, Pierce.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>I can't control it.</p>
<p>There's a little pilot in there.</p>
<p>Whoa! Stop it.</p>
<p>Knuckle walkers.</p>
<p>Sorry, it was an accident.</p>
<p>So was the Y chromosome, but you don't see us throwing stuff at it.</p>
<p>Where are you guys going? Away from your symbolically invasive balls to a women's studies class.</p>
<p>Which women's class? Feminist Representations in Media.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Abed, we kind of thought this would be something just for the girls.</p>
<p>Sounds like it.</p>
<p>I'd love to learn more about you.</p>
<p>I'll change out of my sport clothes and meet you there.</p>
<p>Um --</p>
<p># You just lost #</p>
<p># You just lost a game #</p>
<p># You just lost #</p>
<p># You just lost a game #</p>
<p># With Troy #</p>
<p>Hey, sore loser.</p>
<p>Yeah, proud of it.</p>
<p>I want a rematch.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>I raced here so I could save us four seats.</p>
<p>Thanks, Abed, but Annie can't see the board from this far back.</p>
<p>She lost her glasses.</p>
<p>I've never seen you wear glasses.</p>
<p>I wear contacts, but I couldn't find them without glasses, which I wear.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>
<p>Are we bad people? No, I love Abed, but sometimes he can't take a hint.</p>
<p>We told him, this is a girl thing.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Excuse me, we were gonna sit there.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, we didn't know, but now we're sitting here, so That's the problem.</p>
<p>You don't seriously expect us to get up and change seats for you.</p>
<p>Well, if you're further in back, less people will see your roots.</p>
<p>Um, excuse me? Oh, the way you excuse your little mustache hairs? You know what? We're good people, so we will find seats elsewhere.</p>
<p>It's called the high road.</p>
<p>I hope it leads to a salon.</p>
<p>Oh! You're back.</p>
<p>The leader's name is Meghan.</p>
<p>Why name your daughter Meghan? Are you stocking up for a bitch shortage? The one with the hole in her sweater's armpit? Or whose sleeves are pushing her fat toward her elbows? No, those are her cronies.</p>
<p>The one with crooked ears and no ankles? Ha.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Sorry, I overdescribed again? No, no, Abed.</p>
<p>Describe those girls all you want.</p>
<p>In fact, what are you doing for lunch? It's Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sometimes I eat in Jeff's car.</p>
<p>Don't tell him.</p>
<p>Troy, where are you? You would go this far to avoid a rematch? Jeff, what is this thing? In my line of work? A multimillion-dollar injury suit.</p>
<p>I thought schools got rid of these things.</p>
<p>I can't believe Greendale allows it.</p>
<p>Greendale doesn't.</p>
<p>That's why it's hidden.</p>
<p>Who else saw you come in? If we say nobody, are you going to stab us with your bush scissors? Of course not.</p>
<p>I'm Joshua.</p>
<p>And this is a place of peace and balance.</p>
<p>A place of nourishment.</p>
<p>A place free from darkness.</p>
<p>Because there's a trampoline? There is something cool about being up here, Jeff.</p>
<p>I mean, at first, I was just jumping, but then But then you started bouncing.</p>
<p>Like a baby on the knee of a goddess.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Jeff, get on.</p>
<p>Oh, one at a time, please.</p>
<p>I must ask you to adhere to two simple principles.</p>
<p>First, for this place to survive it must stay secret.</p>
<p>Second, no double bouncies.</p>
<p>Feet, shoulder width apart.</p>
<p>Knees bent.</p>
<p>Just breathe.</p>
<p>At the apex of each bounce, there's a moment outside of time, outside of words, outside of everything.</p>
<p>A perfect moment.</p>
<p>A silent moment.</p>
<p>I call it the world's whisper.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>And I don't mind admitting you're right.</p>
<p>Which is weird.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds on this thing and I already feel Jeff, you've been up there for an hour.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed, girl in the pink.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Her forehead hangs over her head like a canopy.</p>
<p>Missed a belt loop.</p>
<p>Her stomach spills over her shorts.</p>
<p>Target destroyed.</p>
<p>It's called a muffin top, Abed.</p>
<p>Like a muffin.</p>
<p>Clever.</p>
<p>You guys said it's rude to focus on imperfections.</p>
<p>This is the stuff I filter, right? Absolutely.</p>
<p>It's just kind of a guilty pleasure to hear it about certain girls.</p>
<p>Like Meghan and her friends, because they're bitches.</p>
<p>Oh, hoo-hoo.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Who needs a soda? I'll get it.</p>
<p>I'm making you guys so happy, I wanna keep it going.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Okay, I love Abed so much.</p>
<p>I know, it's like he's one of the girls.</p>
<p>Uh, guys? Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you mind not looking at me? Do you mind that your face makeup doesn't match your neck? When I squint, you look like a circus clown.</p>
<p>Okay, I beg your pardon, geek? I don't even know your peanut-headed ass.</p>
<p>We've never met.</p>
<p>Like your hair and dandruff shampoo.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Filet of Meghan.</p>
<p>Service for one.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed, let's get back to the table.</p>
<p>Yeah, Abed, go with your skank.</p>
<p>Or keep going, up to you.</p>
<p>About what? Her uneven bra padding? You look like you're smuggling a lime and a coconut.</p>
<p>Go away, loser.</p>
<p>Tell that to the stitching in your ratty panties.</p>
<p>Or wear higher jeans on laundry day.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>That dis made me snarf, yo.</p>
<p>You know what, you're dead? You're bow-legged.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>Women of Greendale.</p>
<p>This cafeteria is hereby declared a Bitch-Free Zone.</p>
<p>Whoot, whoot, whoot! I can't tell you how great I feel.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure that you would take to the trampoline's ways.</p>
<p>Some can't.</p>
<p>And some are just natural jumpers.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow, Joshua.</p>
<p>We better bounce.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>That's Sharice.</p>
<p>I had sociology with her last year.</p>
<p>She told me I walk like a dude.</p>
<p>That's awful.</p>
<p>Abed, got anything? I might have something to say about those jeans.</p>
<p>But you guys are sure it's not bad? Isn't bad when doing it to bad girls.</p>
<p>You're really good at it.</p>
<p>You're like a machine.</p>
<p>Like RoboCop.</p>
<p>Exactly like Rowboat Cop.</p>
<p>Sharice is a bad rowboat.</p>
<p>Sink her.</p>
<p>Affirmative.</p>
<p>You look like a dude in those jeans.</p>
<p>They're bad.</p>
<p>Bad.</p>
<p>Hey, you dudes ready to shoot the rock after study group? I'm gonna slit your butts' throats.</p>
<p>Nice catch, losers.</p>
<p>Go get it.</p>
<p>Sorry, Pierce.</p>
<p>We're not really into basketball anymore.</p>
<p>What? What's up with you guys? Why are you acting like that? Like what? Ah! Gay boots.</p>
<p>Lady boots.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>He's a gay wad.</p>
<p>Those as comfortable as they look? They're like wearing a pair of dreams.</p>
<p>I'm sure your shoes are fine, though.</p>
<p>You know what? They are.</p>
<p>Something's up with you two.</p>
<p>I wanna know what it is.</p>
<p>Are you on weed? Give me some, I'll smoke you two under the table.</p>
<p>Man, I feel so good.</p>
<p>It's like the campus is a gutter and we're spraying it clean.</p>
<p>I need you to come to the bank with me to have words with a certain something.</p>
<p>We'll take them down.</p>
<p>We'll take all these bitches down.</p>
<p>Ladies, are you okay? Take it easy.</p>
<p>Um, did you just tell us what to do? Here's the thing, it's a little rule.</p>
<p>Maybe you're not familiar with it.</p>
<p>Nobody tells me what to do, ever.</p>
<p>Whoa, cowboy.</p>
<p>I surrender.</p>
<p>You hear that? Jeff's a bitch too? Yes.</p>
<p>Take him down.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff, what's with the boots? that even in 2008, those were tacky.</p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Why don't we just all take a deep breath and find some center? Okay, that is it.</p>
<p>What are you hiding from me? They're keeping relaxation secrets.</p>
<p>Tell me how to get laid back or I'll kill your families! Okay, this place is lame.</p>
<p>Girls.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Toodles.</p>
<p>I'm watching you two.</p>
<p>Twenty four, 2010.</p>
<p>These balls, on your butts.</p>
<p>Quick bounce before lunch? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Let me just make sure that Pierce isn't hovering around.</p>
<p>Coast is clear.</p>
<p>What did you see, my pretty? Wait.</p>
<p>Back, back.</p>
<p>Freeze it.</p>
<p>Can you blow that up a little? Enhance.</p>
<p>Enhance.</p>
<p>Enhance.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Blow it up.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Um, excuse me, girls, you're sitting in our seats.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, what did you say? Oh, I didn't know you were deaf.</p>
<p>I suspected you were blind from the outfit.</p>
<p>Toodles.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>Wait, why were you mean to them? Did they insult you? No, but that top insulted our retinas.</p>
<p>Go, girl.</p>
<p>Bad isn't that bad when you're doing it to bad girls.</p>
<p>Annie, when you laugh like that, you snort like a piglet.</p>
<p>Careful, Abed.</p>
<p>Be careful with your skin.</p>
<p>Your face is puffy, your eyes look like buttons.</p>
<p>Check that attitude at the door.</p>
<p>Check the door before you go through it, Shirley.</p>
<p>What? What? Abed, you cannot talk to us that way.</p>
<p>Someone has to.</p>
<p>You guys are being bitches.</p>
<p>We're not bitches.</p>
<p>We were just joking.</p>
<p>If that makes us bitches, we're all bitches.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Good point, Annie.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>You told him.</p>
<p>Affirmative.</p>
<p>You're all bitches.</p>
<p>Nice shirt.</p>
<p>It would look better on a girl.</p>
<p>You're not fooling us with that Band-Aid, it's a zit.</p>
<p>You're all bitches.</p>
<p>Triple bitches.</p>
<p>Bitch, bitch, bitch.</p>
<p>Hey, bitch.</p>
<p>Bitch.</p>
<p>You're a bitch.</p>
<p>I'm a bitch.</p>
<p>You're a bitch.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>How did you find us? DraganFlyer, beyotch.</p>
<p>So this is the big secret, huh? You two sneak out here and hang out on the big gay trampoline.</p>
<p>Lower your voice, Pierce.</p>
<p>This is our place of peace.</p>
<p>Yes, and now it's mine too.</p>
<p>Mine.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I wanna go higher.</p>
<p>Please, you're doing it all wrong.</p>
<p>I wanna go higher.</p>
<p>Get up here and double bounce me.</p>
<p>That's not how we do things here.</p>
<p>Get up here and double bounce me or I'll tell everybody about this place.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>God as my witness, I will tweet it.</p>
<p>Unh! Double bounce me! Why are you doing this? Double bounce me.</p>
<p>Do it! Pierce, that's enough.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>Double bounce me! Father.</p>
<p>My legs.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my legs! Illegal trampoline! They have an illegal trampoline back there! Black jeans? Nice try, <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Michael Penn</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005304'>Michael Penn</a></span><span class='years'>1958&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>composer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>music_department</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749'>tt0118749</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723816'>tt1723816</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862846'>tt0862846</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119256'>tt0119256</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Bangs aren't covering anything.</p>
<p>Pegged jeans.</p>
<p>Sweater balls.</p>
<p>Crow's feet.</p>
<p>Back hair into neck hair into regular hair?</p>
<p>Look it up because you have it.</p>
<p>You are just mean.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Who taught you how to be a juice box? Don't worry, I come in peace.</p>
<p>And whatever shampoo you're using seems to be doing the trick.</p>
<p>What do you want? To restore the natural order.</p>
<p>What are these? Destruct codes.</p>
<p>Get the blow torch over here.</p>
<p>Well, that seems a little excessive.</p>
<p>Joshua.</p>
<p>We've been looking for you all over.</p>
<p>Where are you going? I got fired.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Joshua, we are so sorry.</p>
<p>Don't apologize.</p>
<p>It's my fault.</p>
<p>Guess that's what I get for trusting some black guy.</p>
<p>What? I thought the only way to protect it was to let you use it.</p>
<p>Guess it goes to prove what I already knew: Non-whites ruin everything.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Joshua was racist? That came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Did it? A place free from darkness.</p>
<p>And some are just natural jumpers.</p>
<p>It's going to be a maze.</p>
<p>Maybe I just didn't wanna believe it.</p>
<p>Maybe that's the lesson here.</p>
<p>Purity that demands exclusion isn't real purity.</p>
<p>Maybe paradise is a lie.</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>Paradise exists.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>For once, he's actually right.</p>
<p>Let me buy you some ice cream.</p>
<p>My white guilt is doing somersaults.</p>
<p>Worth it.</p>
<p>Paradise.</p>
<p>Hey, horse-neck.</p>
<p>So, what's with the clothes? I mean, you look like a toddler who got dressed in the dark.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Snap, here it comes, y'all.</p>
<p>Look at your face.</p>
<p>It's like your mom was a lizard who got raped by a Muppet.</p>
<p>That burn was brought to you by the letter S, as in snap.</p>
<p>What? Too hurt to respond? That's right.</p>
<p>You don't have feelings.</p>
<p>The rest of us feel ashamed of ourselves, so we act like bitches to make ourselves feel better.</p>
<p>But you did it to fit in.</p>
<p>And no matter how hard you try, you never will.</p>
<p>Snap, snap, snap! Give it up! Thank you.</p>
<p>Snap! Snap! Snap! Abed, are you okay? That was so cruel.</p>
<p>I deserved it.</p>
<p>I should have never been mean to anybody.</p>
<p>I tried to fit in, I took it too far.</p>
<p>We took it too far.</p>
<p>We became the kind of women that we hate, turned you into a monster.</p>
<p>Kind of monster that makes outlandish statements about weight.</p>
<p>Those kind of things hurt, even when they're not true.</p>
<p>And all because we were insecure.</p>
<p>Everyone is.</p>

<p>See you.</p>
<p>Wait, why were you mean to them? Did they insult you? No, but that top insulted our retinas.</p>
<p>Go, girl.</p>
<p>Bad isn't that bad when you're doing it to bad girls.</p>
<p>Annie, when you laugh like that, you snort like a piglet.</p>
<p>Careful, Abed.</p>
<p>Be careful with your skin.</p>
<p>Your face is puffy, your eyes look like buttons.</p>
<p>Check that attitude at the door.</p>
<p>Check the door before you go through it, Shirley.</p>
<p>What? What? Abed, you cannot talk to us that way.</p>
<p>Someone has to.</p>
<p>You guys are being bitches.</p>
<p>We're not bitches.</p>
<p>We were just joking.</p>
<p>If that makes us bitches, we're all bitches.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Good point, Annie.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>You told him.</p>
<p>Affirmative.</p>
<p>You're all bitches.</p>
<p>Nice shirt.</p>
<p>It would look better on a girl.</p>
<p>You're not fooling us with that Band-Aid, it's a zit.</p>
<p>You're all bitches.</p>
<p>Triple bitches.</p>
<p>Bitch, bitch, bitch.</p>
<p>Hey, bitch.</p>
<p>Bitch.</p>
<p>You're a bitch.</p>
<p>I'm a bitch.</p>
<p>You're a bitch.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>How did you find us? DraganFlyer, beyotch.</p>
<p>So this is the big secret, huh? You two sneak out here and hang out on the big gay trampoline.</p>
<p>Lower your voice, Pierce.</p>
<p>This is our place of peace.</p>
<p>Yes, and now it's mine too.</p>
<p>Mine.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I wanna go higher.</p>
<p>Please, you're doing it all wrong.</p>
<p>I wanna go higher.</p>
<p>Get up here and double bounce me.</p>
<p>That's not how we do things here.</p>
<p>Get up here and double bounce me or I'll tell everybody about this place.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>God as my witness, I will tweet it.</p>
<p>Unh! Double bounce me! Why are you doing this? Double bounce me.</p>
<p>Do it! Pierce, that's enough.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>Double bounce me! Father.</p>
<p>My legs.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my legs! Illegal trampoline! They have an illegal trampoline back there! Black jeans? Nice try, Michael Penn.</p>
<p>Bangs aren't covering anything.</p>
<p>Pegged jeans.</p>
<p>Sweater balls.</p>
<p>Crow's feet.</p>
<p>Back hair into neck hair into regular hair?</p>
<p>Look it up because you have it.</p>
<p>You are just mean.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Who taught you how to be a juice box? Don't worry, I come in peace.</p>
<p>And whatever shampoo you're using seems to be doing the trick.</p>
<p>What do you want? To restore the natural order.</p>
<p>What are these? Destruct codes.</p>
<p>Get the blow torch over here.</p>
<p>Well, that seems a little excessive.</p>
<p>Joshua.</p>
<p>We've been looking for you all over.</p>
<p>Where are you going? I got fired.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Joshua, we are so sorry.</p>
<p>Don't apologize.</p>
<p>It's my fault.</p>
<p>Guess that's what I get for trusting some black guy.</p>
<p>What? I thought the only way to protect it was to let you use it.</p>
<p>Guess it goes to prove what I already knew: Non-whites ruin everything.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Joshua was racist? That came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Did it? A place free from darkness.</p>
<p>And some are just natural jumpers.</p>
<p>It's going to be a maze.</p>
<p>Maybe I just didn't wanna believe it.</p>
<p>Maybe that's the lesson here.</p>
<p>Purity that demands exclusion isn't real purity.</p>
<p>Maybe paradise is a lie.</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>Paradise exists.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>For once, he's actually right.</p>
<p>Let me buy you some ice cream.</p>
<p>My white guilt is doing somersaults.</p>
<p>Worth it.</p>
<p>Paradise.</p>
<p>Hey, horse-neck.</p>
<p>So, what's with the clothes? I mean, you look like a toddler who got dressed in the dark.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Snap, here it comes, y'all.</p>
<p>Look at your face.</p>
<p>It's like your mom was a lizard who got raped by a Muppet.</p>
<p>That burn was brought to you by the letter S, as in snap.</p>
<p>What? Too hurt to respond? That's right.</p>
<p>You don't have feelings.</p>
<p>The rest of us feel ashamed of ourselves, so we act like bitches to make ourselves feel better.</p>
<p>But you did it to fit in.</p>
<p>And no matter how hard you try, you never will.</p>
<p>Snap, snap, snap! Give it up! Thank you.</p>
<p>Snap! Snap! Snap! Abed, are you okay? That was so cruel.</p>
<p>I deserved it.</p>
<p>I should have never been mean to anybody.</p>
<p>I tried to fit in, I took it too far.</p>
<p>We took it too far.</p>
<p>We became the kind of women that we hate, turned you into a monster.</p>
<p>Kind of monster that makes outlandish statements about weight.</p>
<p>Those kind of things hurt, even when they're not true.</p>
<p>And all because we were insecure.</p>
<p>Everyone is.</p>
<p>Even Tom Cruise knows he's short and nuts.</p>
<p>We're at the mercy of each other.</p>
<p>That's why there has to be forgiveness on both sides.</p>
<p>Oh, Abed.</p>
<p>Goodness.</p>
<p>What happened to Pierce? Long story.</p>
<p>Men.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pierce, will you knock it off? I told you, I'm not controlling it, there's a little man inside.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Listen, I wanted to let you know, Pierce, it's okay to exceed the recommended daily dosage.</p>
<p>And don't let anybody tell you different! Who's going to be in charge of making sure he doesn't OD? What? When did we start doing that? Three, two, one.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed in the Morning And we're back with Greendale's resident animal expert, Star-Burns.</p>
<p>My name is Alex.</p>
<p>Star-Burns joins us with his pet turtle, Shelly.</p>
<p>Now, I understand Shelly can eat over five mice a day.</p>
<p>That's impressive.</p>
<p>Turtles don't eat mice.</p>
<p>What do they eat? I don't know.</p>
<p>Pellets? I have no idea.</p>
<p>That's disappointing.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>What is going on? I was studying for my econ midterm.</p>
<p>You guys walk in, hand me this turtle and tell me to smile for the folks at home.</p>
<p>What folks at home? These things give you salmonella, you know.</p>
<p>Let's go to Garrett with a check on the weather.</p>
<p>It's still sunny.</p>
