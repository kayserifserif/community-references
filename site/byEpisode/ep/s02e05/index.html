<p>This is what happened.</p>
<p>We was camping.</p>
<p>We was eating.</p>
<p>And it was mountain lion jumped all the way down and eat my leg.</p>
<p>I think a mountain lion jumped down and eat someone's grammar.</p>
<p>Right? The auto-tune remix is way better.</p>
<p>Go to related videos.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Professor? Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>Don't start, we've been through this.</p>
<p>Anthropology is the study of humanity, nothing is off-topic.</p>
<p>No, it's just, I've seen this one.</p>
<p>Put in "Car Crash Camel Toe." </p>
<p>Oh, wait, wait, wait, "Ski Lift Ninja Crotch Rip." </p>

<p>Stop that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can do what I want.</p>
<p>What happens if you type in "God"? Everyone hates you and asks you Do not boo her.</p>
<p>This subject's lack of definition cuts both ways.</p>
<p>If farts are fair game, so is God.</p>
<p>Top hit, "God of Farts." </p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You asked for it.</p>
<p>It balances out.</p>
<p>That's blasphemous.</p>
<p>Who wants to see that? Seventeen million people.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>There were nine people at my church last night.</p>
<p>Auto-tune "God of Farts." </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Way ahead of you.</p>
<p>Abed? Guess who's got two thumbs and has a career opportunity for you? This guy.</p>
<p>I'm pointing my thumbs at God.</p>
<p>One thumb to say, "That's great." </p>
<p>I told my pastor about YouTube and how there's no light there.</p>
<p>Our church wants to sponsor the making of a video with a Christian message.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>What, "Rapping Jesus"? Pierce, please step aside and make room for a new generation.</p>
<p>Abed, would you like to make a Christian YouTube? You're Muslim As a Muslim, I'd be happy to.</p>
<p>As a filmmaker, no.</p>
<p>I'm a storyteller, not a preacher.</p>
<p>The Bible has been called the greatest story ever told.</p>
<p>Ben Lyons said the same thing about I Am Legend.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I'll have to rent that then.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What? That's a lot of pasta for no veggies.</p>
<p>You're not in charge of what I eat.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>And some damn broccoli, please.</p>
<p>Pierce has been acting out a lot lately, maybe you should talk to him.</p>
<p>How is that my job? Aren't you, like, the dad? Would the dad walk away from this conversation? No? Uh, you're having cookies for lunch? Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, you didn't pay for those.</p>
<p>Call a cop.</p>
<p>Heads up, gay wads.</p>
<p>Oh, yummy.</p>
<p>They're better when they're free.</p>
<p>Fresh and stolen.</p>
<p>What are you looking at? Your face.</p>
<p>That's what you're supposed to look at.</p>
<p>So? So you gonna sit down or what? Oh, no, I usually sit with the younger people.</p>
<p>Well, la di da di da.</p>
<p>No, no, we watch videos on YouTune, and you guys don't know what that is.</p>
<p>We don't care.</p>
<p>Pierce, looking for us? We're sitting over there.</p>
<p>I can see.</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p>
<p>Did you take your pills? Ooh.</p>
<p>Meet Mama's boy.</p>
<p>We're having a private conversation here.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Britta.</p>
<p>Pierce's Pbbt! Very nice meeting you guys.</p>
<p>"Very nice meeting you guys." </p>
<p>She's a lesbian.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Shirley, I read the New Testament.</p>
<p>The whole thing? Being raised by TV and movies, I thought Jesus walked on water and told people not to have abortions, but it's cooler.</p>

<p>I'd love to make a Jesus movie.</p>
<p>Abed, that's wonderful.</p>
<p>What do you think we should do? Needs to be cool and addictive.</p>
<p>Like that video of the kitten falling asleep.</p>
<p>The story's been told to death, I wanna approach it in a new way.</p>
<p>We need a Jesus movie for the post post-modern world.</p>
<p>Like Jesus as a rapper? No.</p>
<p>I wanna tell the story of Jesus from the perspective of a filmmaker exploring the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>That sounds very appealing to filmmakers.</p>
<p>In the film, Jesus is a filmmaker trying to find God with his camera.</p>
<p>The filmmaker realizes that he's Jesus and he's being filmed by God's camera.</p>
<p>It goes like that forever because the filmmakers are Jesus and the cameras are God.</p>
<p>And the movie is called, ABED.</p>
<p>All caps.</p>
<p>Filmmaking beyond film.</p>
<p>A meta film.</p>
<p>My masterpiece.</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>You're reacting the way the world did to Jesus.</p>
<p>I'm reacting the way the world does to movies about making movies about making movies.</p>
<p>Come on, Charlie Kaufman, some of us have work in the morning.</p>
<p>You don't wanna work on the movie? This means there is no movie.</p>
<p>This is the movie.</p>
<p>The game is Jacks and Deuces wild.</p>
<p>Except if the dean comes in and then it's Bingo.</p>
<p>Keep it, I got another one.</p>
<p>If you get caught with that, just say it's your 90th birthday.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it's adorable.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right now.</p>
<p>What is this again? B-19.</p>
<p>No, B-19 my butt, I told you guys, no poker.</p>
<p>All right, shut this down.</p>
<p>Shut your mouth down, fruit.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, unacceptable.</p>
<p>None of your business, and barely the truth.</p>
<p>All right, everyone, go home.</p>
<p>Excuse me, mister? What, Pierce? What year is it? What? Poker helps him remember.</p>
<p>Veronica.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You're okay, kid.</p>
<p>Shut up and deal, let's go.</p>
<p>Jesus, did you really die for our sins? That's dopey.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, dope.</p>
<p>Oh, Freudian slip.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to my feeling dopey.</p>
<p>Do the line, atheist.</p>
<p>Jesus, did you really die for our sins? That's dope.</p>
<p>If you think that's dope, check out these "beat-titudes." </p>
<p># Blessed be the peacemaker's word #</p>
<p># To the meek #</p>
<p># The kingdom of Heaven #</p>
<p># Is open all week #</p>
<p># Jesus and me #</p>
<p>I have arrived.</p>
<p>I am watched as I am watching.</p>
<p>I am audience and creation.</p>
<p>The Earth shall know my power.</p>
<p>Abed, what are you doing? Oh, great.</p>
<p>You blew the take.</p>
<p>No, no, keep rolling.</p>
<p>This can all be part of it.</p>
<p>Ahh, there are no takes.</p>
<p>There is no viewer.</p>
<p>The film is the story, the story is us.</p>
<p>We are the film.</p>
<p>This is totally meta.</p>
<p>Let's get back to our non-meta production, shall we? Come on.</p>
<p>No, I wanna watch this.</p>
<p>Troy, there's no time.</p>
<p>Then we quit.</p>
<p>Right, Britta? I don't even believe in God, but I love me some Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you? But -- oh, look at it.</p>
<p>"The story of the story is the story." </p>
<p>Sure, that'll play in Poughkeepsie.</p>
<p>I heard some theaters are gonna show it in reverse.</p>
<p>I heard it's the same movie backward and forward.</p>
<p>I heard the deleted scenes are the scenes and the scenes are the deleted scenes.</p>
<p>I heard Jesus died for our sins.</p>
<p>Wait, guys.</p>
<p>The director's answering questions in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>And it both is and isn't part of the movie.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Get a table.</p>
<p>Abed, are we all in the movie right now? We are all in a movie even when there are no cameras.</p>
<p>When will the movie be released? When is life released? Every minute is a world premiere.</p>
<p>My father has already bought the popcorn.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Abed? But you aren't actually trying to say that you're Jesus, are you? I am who you say I am.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>It's meta now.</p>
<p>Except here is a thing: I am a devout Christian, and you guys are feeding into this poor boy's delusions.</p>
<p>So cool.</p>
<p>She's an actual, real-life Pharisee.</p>
<p>Hey, bitch, why don't you go back to your temple?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why don't you all stop confusing Jesus with an egotistical, filmmaking lunatic? I forgive her.</p>
<p>So how's your film going, Abed? Blasphemously.</p>
<p>It's not blasphemy to say that we are God, Shirley.</p>
<p>First Corinthians: He who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.</p>
<p>Did you just scripture me, Muslim? Jesus was Jewish.</p>
<p>Are you ever gonna let that go?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>No religious talk.</p>
<p>Somebody's late.</p>
<p>What is that in your pocket? Jeff, Britta, Pierce is smoking cigars.</p>
<p>What's it to you, butt breath? Oh.</p>
<p>Look at your eyes.</p>
<p>Out all night with those hipsters? Hipsters? Pack of old people in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>"Hipsters" because they have hip replacements.</p>
<p>They do not.</p>
<p>Leonard will probably kick your ass.</p>
<p>Leonard? You're hanging out with Leonard? You know I hate him.</p>
<p>So? Everybody hates him.</p>
<p>That's why he's cool.</p>
<p>You people don't get it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that I want to get it.</p>
<p>Take a break from these new friends of yours.</p>
<p>They've got you riled up.</p>
<p>That's what Leonard said you'd say.</p>
<p>Well, Leonard is not a part of this study group.</p>
<p>So you apologize right now to What? I'm not your father.</p>
<p>I never said you were.</p>
<p>Where are you going? Out.</p>
<p>Uh, when did Pierce become awesome? I'm gonna shut you down, know that? I do.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm supposed to shut you down.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna do it.</p>
<p>Don't.</p>
<p>I won't.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I am gonna shut you down.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You should have seen his face.</p>
<p>He was terrified.</p>
<p>You're his worst nightmare now.</p>
<p>You're old and you don't give a damn.</p>
<p>Boo-yah! Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Don't make eye contact, we'll be fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Silly old wuss.</p>
<p>Hey --</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The dude is got a date.</p>
<p>Little lovely.</p>
<p>Please give us a break, will you?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Don't wanna see you when I come back.</p>
<p>Go, run.</p>
<p>We've made them angry.</p>
<p>We've made them angry.</p>
<p>He left his keys.</p>
<p>Oh, who's up for a joy ride? I don't know.</p>
<p>We could get into serious trouble.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>If we get caught, we can just pretend we're disoriented, they can give us a ride home.</p>
<p>Where am I? What year is it? But we've all been drinking.</p>
<p>Oh, grow a schmekel.</p>
<p>Okay, everyone, this is the last scene.</p>
<p>I wanna thank you all for contributing to the greatest film ever made.</p>
<p>And on the seventh day, Shirley shut down production.</p>
<p>Abed, Shirley has informed me you are using school equipment on school property to make a religious film.</p>
<p>She has filed an official complaint, invoking the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>Pointed out the irony to her.</p>
<p>Don't give a crap.</p>
<p>Let's be ironic, shut it down.</p>
<p>Abed, are you making a religious film? All movies are religious to me.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But is it a movie about Jesus? Is The Matrix? Is RoboCop? Is Superman Returns? All stories are about death and resurrection.</p>
<p>I've got one, Wrath of Khan.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>Spock sacrifices himself for the crew and gets reborn.</p>

I'm serious Except in Abed's film, the character's name isn't Spock.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>It's Abed.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I'm getting creative goosebumps here.</p>
<p>I love Charlie Kaufman.</p>
<p>I need to run into editing, grab a chair and you can watch a take.</p>
<p>I would love that.</p>
<p>I've never watched a take before.</p>
<p>This is exciting.</p>
<p>Uh, you say what you will about Abed, but the man cannot be killed.</p>
<p>I mean, it's almost like he's Jesus.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I don't think we should be driving, I mean, we're all, you know, old and groggy.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Stop worrying.</p>
<p>Richard flew zeroes during the Big One.</p>
<p>What do you mean "flew zeroes"? He's not Japanese.</p>
<p>What did you fly during the Big One, Rich? Where am I? Oh, come on, stop farting around.</p>
<p>Seriously, I don't know where I am.</p>
<p>What year is it? How do I drive? Hey, give me it.</p>
<p>Look out, look out.</p>
<p>Let's bail.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, what about Richard? Screw Richard, it's every man for himself.</p>
<p>I'm getting out of here.</p>
<p>Richard, are you all right? Well, am I Richard? Yes.</p>
<p>Then I'm fine.</p>
<p>But who are those people that ran away? Our friends? That's a good question.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What is?</p>
<p>There are no takes.</p>
<p> There is no viewer.</p>
<p>The film is the story, the story is us.</p>
<p>We are the film.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? I need to take a walk.</p>
<p>Dear God.</p>
<p>My movie is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.</p>
<p>How could I have been so blind? It's a self-indulgent, adolescent mess.</p>
<p>I can barely sit through it.</p>
<p>And now with all this hype, I've got a real Snakes on a Plane brewing.</p>
<p>Critics are gonna crucify me, my career will be over before it begins.</p>
<p>God, if you're out there, I know I don't deserve it, but I need your help.</p>
<p>Please take this project away from me.</p>
<p>Make it rain.</p>
<p>Send a meteor.</p>
<p>Anything.</p>
<p>Please? Now? Okay, I get it.</p>
<p>This is what I deserve.</p>
<p>I'll finish it up.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm Pierce Hawthorne's emergency contact.</p>
<p>Here to pick him up? No.</p>
<p>I'm here to be removed as his emergency contact.</p>
<p>One second.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I've got a class.</p>
<p>Does anybody have? Where is everybody? Is anyone coming to get Leonard? No, nobody comes for him anymore.</p>
<p>His kids asked us to stop calling them.</p>
<p>Why do you think he acts like that? So we're in prison, right? All right, bring him out.</p>
<p>Come here, Pierce.</p>
<p>Up, up.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Go wait in the car.</p>
<p>It wasn't my fault.</p>
<p>Go wait in the car.</p>
<p>You want me to change that or not? I guess not.</p>
<p>Could you do me a favor? Could you add Britta Perry as a contact? P-E-R-R-Y.</p>
<p>Give her a call a couple times a week? She gets pretty worried about him.</p>
<p>And she works days, so make sure you call at night.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks what you did was destined to happen.</p>
<p>That it was proof God was making my movie.</p>
<p>A movie so good it could never exist.</p>
<p>They think I'm a genius, and they think you're a villain.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You heard me praying.</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p>Oh, this is gonna be good.</p>
<p>Abed sent me a new link and that man knows his video virality.</p>
<p>So you're just gonna drop all pretense of actually teaching us? Yeah.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p># Blessed be the peacemaker's word #</p>
<p># To the meek #</p>
<p># The kingdom of Heaven #</p>
<p># Is open all week #</p>
<p>You finished my movie.</p>
<p>Don't know what you mean.</p>
<p># Only from the saint there #</p>
<p># Lepers have feet there #</p>
<p># Dogs love cats there #</p>
<p># Cats love mice #</p>
<p>You humble me.</p>
<p>You humble me too.</p>
<p># And the tables are pies #</p>
<p># Ice cream is everywhere #</p>
<p># But never on your thighs #</p>
<p># Good news is #</p>
<p># It can be your hood #</p>
<p>Okay, open your books because Abed has broken the Internet.</p>
<p># As in word of God, yo #</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So which one of us is gonna head home and -</p>
<p>Change.</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>So you guys bought one of my outfits, and then staked out my apartment every day until I wore it? That's not pathetic.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, good job.</p>
<p>I guess I'm heading home to change now.</p>
<p>I hit traffic, did I miss it? Darn it.</p>
