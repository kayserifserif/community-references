<p>Happy last day before winter break, Greendale.</p>
<p>Time to visit our loved ones.</p>
<p>Some of you will travel as far as three miles.</p>
<p>Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland, where we're giving away catalogues of next semester's classes.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha! Whoa! What's that sound? Is that the tippy-tapping of secular boots on the roof? Oh, well, it must be yet another sign that it 'tis the season, because rumor has it that non-denominational Mr. Winter is on his way to the student lounge.</p>
<p>I am so sick of the dean jamming his PCness down my throat.</p>
<p>Pierce, I'd like to commend you for letting that one go.</p>
<p>PCness.</p>
<p>Now I get it.</p>
<p>It sounds like penis.</p>
<p>I just got it too.</p>
<p>Well, it's still Christmas to all of us.</p>
<p>And I made you all a little gift, because you're like my new family.</p>
<p>"W.W.B.J.D?" </p>
<p>If that stands for "What would <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Billy Joel</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005055'>Billy Joel</a></span><span class='years'>1949&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>composer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998'>tt2704998</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846'>tt0993846</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694'>tt0104694</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095776'>tt0095776</a></span></span></span></span> do?" I'll tell you right now, he'd write another crappy song.</p>
<p>Yeah, in your face, <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Billy Joel</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005055'>Billy Joel</a></span><span class='years'>1949&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>composer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998'>tt2704998</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846'>tt0993846</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694'>tt0104694</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095776'>tt0095776</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Who is that? It stands for "What would baby Jesus do? " And it's to remind us that the real meaning of this season is Christmas.</p>
<p>Oh, well, thank you, Shirley.</p>
<p>I'm gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It's a bracelet, you put them on.</p>
<p>Everybody put them on.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>You took all the Winter-Doodles.</p>
<p>What are you, a douche bag? They're for my friends.</p>
<p>But there's a lot left.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Only macadamia nut cookies.</p>
<p>I have a tree-nut allergy.</p>
<p>You should stay away from Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha! That did not even make allergic sense.</p>
<p>What are you, an idiot? Okay, we get it, you and the A-Team are awesome, now beat it.</p>
<p>Oh, look at that.</p>
<p>Pretty boy, standing up for bird-face over here.</p>
<p>Give me a Winter-Doodle.</p>
<p>If you're trying to be menacing, maybe don't call the cookie by its name.</p>
<p>Oh, you're funny, you're a funny man.</p>
<p>Wanna hear something funny? Knock, knock.</p>
<p>My fist up your balls.</p>
<p>Who's there? Ho, ho, ho! Merry happy.</p>
<p>This ain't over.</p>
<p>There won't always be a dean around, all right? Still waiting on those cookies, Abed.</p>
<p>Jeff protected my honor.</p>
<p>It was like My Bodyguard, but I was the kid from Meatballs, Jeff was from Full Metal Jacket, and the mustache guy was the brother of the guy in Entourage.</p>
<p>Thanks for dumbing that down for us.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>What's the deal, Jeff? You leave your stones in your other suit? Why didn't you rap that guy in the face? For the same reason that I floss and keep my guitar in its case.</p>
<p>I'm over 23.</p>
<p>I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff.</p>
<p>Like a certain little birthday boy.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>Real men turn the other cheek.</p>
<p>Let's see them.</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>Men were wired to fight each other so women could choose the right mate.</p>
<p>No, the real reason men fight is to release their pent-up gayness.</p>
<p>That guy wasn't gay, he had a mustache.</p>
<p>You know what I have? Finals.</p>
<p>Are we cramming for Spanish or not? I need a 65 or I'm gonna flunk the class.</p>
<p>Why didn't you do the extra credit if you knew that you were failing? Because doing more than the minimum work is my definition of failing.</p>
<p>Quick question.</p>
<p>Are you all coming to my Christmas party right after the final or are you stopping home to change into your Christmas outfits? I guess I could wear one of my Hanukkah sweaters.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Annie, I didn't know you weren't, um, Christian.</p>
<p>Yep, one might even say I'm Jewish.</p>
<p>Oh, that's good for you.</p>
<p>That's wonderful.</p>
<p>I respect all religions of the world.</p>
<p>I'm Muslim.</p>
<p>Jehovah's Witness.</p>
<p>Atheist.</p>
<p>The Lord is testing me.</p>
<p>Guys, this is a subject that breeds conflict, can we please? What religion are you, Jeff? I'm agnostic.</p>
<p>Agnostic.</p>
<p>Lazy man's atheist.</p>
<p>I'm born-again.</p>
<p>Oh! We had a re-birthing ritual in my friend's hot tub.</p>
<p>I'm now a level five Laser Lotus in my Buddhist community.</p>
<p>That does not sound like Buddhism.</p>
<p>You sure you're not in a cult? Just by asking me that question, you put me back down to a level four.</p>
<p>You now owe me Do you know how foolish you sound right now? What else do you believe in, blood transfusions? Jehovah's Witnesses are a type of Christian, right, Troy? Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink.</p>
<p>But it helps.</p>
<p>So you're like a Muslim.</p>
<p>Assalamu alaikum.</p>
<p>Shama-lama-ding-dong.</p>
<p>Well, don't we have a diverse little family.</p>
<p>I say we open up this party to all faiths.</p>
<p>I brought my Star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind.</p>
<p>And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies.</p>
<p>Sounds good? As an agnostic, I'm gonna bring my winning smile.</p>
<p>Ugh! So boring.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Hee, hee! Feliz navidad.</p>
<p>"True or false or none of the above?" That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Hey, look at that, Forehead's taking a test.</p>
<p>Why don't you get going, <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Chuck Norris</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001569'>Chuck Norris</a></span><span class='years'>1940&ndash;</span><span class='profs popupList'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>music_department</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span></span><span class='knownFor popupList'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094792'>tt0094792</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764651'>tt1764651</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068935'>tt0068935</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106168'>tt0106168</a></span></span></span></span>? Did you just shoo me? Why don't you just kiss him already? Dude, I will shoo your nose down your throat.</p>
<p>Señor Chang, can you do something about this? I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Qué pasa here, huh? It's usted, dude.</p>
<p>Even I know that.</p>
<p>You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, No Sleeves.</p>
<p>It's on.</p>
<p>He's doing this for me.</p>
<p>He's my bodyguard.</p>
<p>You wanna dance? To some show tunes? No, I want to beat you, and I'm gonna enjoy it.</p>
<p>Because you're like this school.</p>
<p>You're obnoxious, cramping my style and you smell like french-fry oil.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>Three o'clock.</p>
<p>Bike rack, but not the one by the parking lot.</p>
<p>Right, the one by the trash cans, near the orange cones, where they're building the wheelchair ramp.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Best exam ever.</p>
<p>That guy's awesome.</p>
<p>So help me, if that jerkweed made me fail.</p>
<p>Well, I aced it, amigo.</p>
<p>That means cousin.</p>
<p>So, what's my role going to be? Is there a key moment where I stand up for myself, take revenge? Uh, maybe you should just hang back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I will.</p>
<p>In his face.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight.</p>
<p>She'll start in with all her mothery guilt-inducing powers.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? No.</p>
<p>I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet because it gets me chicks.</p>
<p>I know guys like this Mike.</p>
<p>He used to be a nerd, now he's a meathead.</p>
<p>Dangerous combo.</p>

<p>You're a pretty big dude.</p>
<p>You've probably got moves.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got some theories.</p>
<p>You've never been in a fight? Technically, no.</p>
<p>I guess I'm too charming and likeable.</p>
<p>Call me a name.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Are you telling me you've never been punched in the face? No, thank God.</p>
<p>This is the moneymaker.</p>
<p>First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no." </p>
<p>But then I was like, "This is a story." </p>
<p>And a good one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Every man should be punched in the face.</p>
<p>It's a rite of passage.</p>
<p>In my day, Friday night was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal and then get your teeth knocked out by a Republican.</p>
<p>Guys, the plan here isn't for me to get hit.</p>
<p>It's for me to hit him.</p>
<p>Oh, then it's settled.</p>
<p>We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight.</p>
<p>I know a few moves.</p>
<p>Troy, I assume you're handy with a switchblade.</p>
<p>Abed, you get back to the family tent, try to find a chicken for Jeff to chase.</p>
<p>Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think I got this.</p>
<p>Oh, well, look who it is.</p>
<p>We got Forehead, Old Head, Dumb Head and the Other Head.</p>
<p>See you at 3, Forehead.</p>
<p>Give me a snowman, dork.</p>
<p>See this, funny guy? Huh? Huh? Classic Rosie.</p>
<p>Fight lessons in a half an hour? Good plan.</p>
<p># Joy to the world, the Lord is come #</p>
<p># The Lord, the Lord, the Lord #</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh! Is this your Hanukkah holder? It's, uh, it's pretty.</p>
<p>We'll just, uh --</p>
<p>Let's just put it here.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.</p>
<p>I'd say the whole word next time.</p>
<p>So do you think everyone will start arriving soon? I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.</p>
<p>After Jeff's what, now? Jeff wants to fight that bully.</p>
<p>On Christmas? Will you excuse me for a moment? Can you finish the manger scene? We know you were one of us.</p>
<p>What's up? What's up? What's up.</p>
<p>No, it's a question.</p>
<p>What's up? What's up? Not a real question, a rhetorical one.</p>

<p>Oh, that's pretty good.</p>
<p>Okay, hold that stare.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Hold it.</p>
<p>Then, look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.</p>
<p>And then you move to Vermont.</p>
<p>I'm sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay.</p>
<p>She's got a point.</p>
<p>In boxing, you fight for the purse and a belt.</p>
<p>I've gotta write a paper about that.</p>
<p>Let's see what we're working with.</p>
<p>Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws.</p>
<p>What are you? A North Korean seamstress? Not if that's bad.</p>
<p>Get mad, come on! If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Britta, put your blouse back on.</p>
<p>Ohh! Ow! This is not a game.</p>
<p>You gotta be ready for anything.</p>
<p>Dude, that is not cool.</p>
<p>Well, that foxy black girl thinks it is.</p>
<p>Hm? Aah! What are you doing? Why she have to be black? What is going on? We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fight.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of another word.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>He meant we were figh--ting.</p>
<p>It is hard to think of another word.</p>
<p>You realize there's no way to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.</p>
<p>December 10th? It's our Christmas.</p>
<p>And I'm having a party.</p>
<p>Due to my divorce, and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year.</p>
<p>Will you be there or will I have another family letting me down? I told him not to fight.</p>
<p>He wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I have two boys.</p>
<p>And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax.</p>
<p>So why do you hate me and Jesus? I don't think my brownie's working.</p>
<p>Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.</p>
<p>Again, it's December 10th.</p>
<p>You think religion is stupid.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>

<p>Lazy man's atheist.</p>
<p>I'm born-again.</p>
<p>Oh! We had a re-birthing ritual in my friend's hot tub.</p>
<p>I'm now a level five Laser Lotus in my Buddhist community.</p>
<p>That does not sound like Buddhism.</p>
<p>You sure you're not in a cult? Just by asking me that question, you put me back down to a level four.</p>
<p>You now owe me Do you know how foolish you sound right now? What else do you believe in, blood transfusions? Jehovah's Witnesses are a type of Christian, right, Troy? Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink.</p>
<p>But it helps.</p>
<p>So you're like a Muslim.</p>
<p>Assalamu alaikum.</p>
<p>Shama-lama-ding-dong.</p>
<p>Well, don't we have a diverse little family.</p>
<p>I say we open up this party to all faiths.</p>
<p>I brought my Star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind.</p>
<p>And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies.</p>
<p>Sounds good? As an agnostic, I'm gonna bring my winning smile.</p>
<p>Ugh! So boring.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Hee, hee! Feliz navidad.</p>
<p>"True or false or none of the above?" That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Hey, look at that, Forehead's taking a test.</p>
<p>Why don't you get going, Chuck Norris? Did you just shoo me? Why don't you just kiss him already? Dude, I will shoo your nose down your throat.</p>
<p>Señor Chang, can you do something about this? I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Qué pasa here, huh? It's usted, dude.</p>
<p>Even I know that.</p>
<p>You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, No Sleeves.</p>
<p>It's on.</p>
<p>He's doing this for me.</p>
<p>He's my bodyguard.</p>
<p>You wanna dance? To some show tunes? No, I want to beat you, and I'm gonna enjoy it.</p>
<p>Because you're like this school.</p>
<p>You're obnoxious, cramping my style and you smell like french-fry oil.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>Three o'clock.</p>
<p>Bike rack, but not the one by the parking lot.</p>
<p>Right, the one by the trash cans, near the orange cones, where they're building the wheelchair ramp.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Best exam ever.</p>
<p>That guy's awesome.</p>
<p>So help me, if that jerkweed made me fail.</p>
<p>Well, I aced it, amigo.</p>
<p>That means cousin.</p>
<p>So, what's my role going to be? Is there a key moment where I stand up for myself, take revenge? Uh, maybe you should just hang back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I will.</p>
<p>In his face.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight.</p>
<p>She'll start in with all her mothery guilt-inducing powers.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? No.</p>
<p>I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet because it gets me chicks.</p>
<p>I know guys like this Mike.</p>
<p>He used to be a nerd, now he's a meathead.</p>
<p>Dangerous combo.</p>
<p>Tyson, Lou Ferrigno, Rosie O'Donnell.</p>
<p>You're a pretty big dude.</p>
<p>You've probably got moves.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got some theories.</p>
<p>You've never been in a fight? Technically, no.</p>
<p>I guess I'm too charming and likeable.</p>
<p>Call me a name.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Are you telling me you've never been punched in the face? No, thank God.</p>
<p>This is the moneymaker.</p>
<p>First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no." </p>
<p>But then I was like, "This is a story." </p>
<p>And a good one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Every man should be punched in the face.</p>
<p>It's a rite of passage.</p>
<p>In my day, Friday night was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal and then get your teeth knocked out by a Republican.</p>
<p>Guys, the plan here isn't for me to get hit.</p>
<p>It's for me to hit him.</p>
<p>Oh, then it's settled.</p>
<p>We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight.</p>
<p>I know a few moves.</p>
<p>Troy, I assume you're handy with a switchblade.</p>
<p>Abed, you get back to the family tent, try to find a chicken for Jeff to chase.</p>
<p>Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think I got this.</p>
<p>Oh, well, look who it is.</p>
<p>We got Forehead, Old Head, Dumb Head and the Other Head.</p>
<p>See you at 3, Forehead.</p>
<p>Give me a snowman, dork.</p>
<p>See this, funny guy? Huh? Huh? Classic Rosie.</p>
<p>Fight lessons in a half an hour? Good plan.</p>
<p># Joy to the world, the Lord is come #</p>
<p># The Lord, the Lord, the Lord #</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh! Is this your Hanukkah holder? It's, uh, it's pretty.</p>
<p>We'll just, uh --</p>
<p>Let's just put it here.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.</p>
<p>I'd say the whole word next time.</p>
<p>So do you think everyone will start arriving soon? I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.</p>
<p>After Jeff's what, now? Jeff wants to fight that bully.</p>
<p>On Christmas? Will you excuse me for a moment? Can you finish the manger scene? We know you were one of us.</p>
<p>What's up? What's up? What's up.</p>
<p>No, it's a question.</p>
<p>What's up? What's up? Not a real question, a rhetorical one.</p>
<p>You have the answer, he does not.</p>
<p>Then you give them the Forest Whitaker eye.</p>
<p>Oh, that's pretty good.</p>
<p>Okay, hold that stare.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Hold it.</p>
<p>Then, look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.</p>
<p>And then you move to Vermont.</p>
<p>I'm sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay.</p>
<p>She's got a point.</p>
<p>In boxing, you fight for the purse and a belt.</p>
<p>I've gotta write a paper about that.</p>
<p>Let's see what we're working with.</p>
<p>Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws.</p>
<p>What are you? A North Korean seamstress? Not if that's bad.</p>
<p>Get mad, come on! If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Britta, put your blouse back on.</p>
<p>Ohh! Ow! This is not a game.</p>
<p>You gotta be ready for anything.</p>
<p>Dude, that is not cool.</p>
<p>Well, that foxy black girl thinks it is.</p>
<p>Hm? Aah! What are you doing? Why she have to be black? What is going on? We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fight.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of another word.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>He meant we were figh--ting.</p>
<p>It is hard to think of another word.</p>
<p>You realize there's no way to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.</p>
<p>December 10th? It's our Christmas.</p>
<p>And I'm having a party.</p>
<p>Due to my divorce, and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year.</p>
<p>Will you be there or will I have another family letting me down? I told him not to fight.</p>
<p>He wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I have two boys.</p>
<p>And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax.</p>
<p>So why do you hate me and Jesus? I don't think my brownie's working.</p>
<p>Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.</p>
<p>Again, it's December 10th.</p>
<p>You think religion is stupid.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>To me, religion is like Paul Rudd.</p>
<p>I see the appeal and would never take it away from anyone, but I would also never stand in line for it.</p>
<p>And, look, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy.</p>
<p>He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish.</p>
<p>So you go to your party and I'll see you soon.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.</p>
<p>Well, you don't get to.</p>
<p>You're not my mom.</p>
<p>You're right, but if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.</p>
<p>I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.</p>
<p>That's Mom for mad.</p>
<p>Oh, hash browns and applesauce, that's nice.</p>
<p>Oh, what is that interesting smell? It's a traditional Muslim dish.</p>
<p>Looks delicious.</p>
<p>I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that.</p>
<p>That's too bad.</p>
<p>Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Where should I put my Buddha incense holder? I'm pretty sure that's a bong.</p>
<p>Where's Jeff? I guess he made his choice.</p>
<p>I wanna go to Jeff's fight.</p>
<p>As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party.</p>
<p>He's dead to me.</p>
<p>And if any of you leave you'll be dead to me too.</p>
<p>Let's sing.</p>
<p># Jesus is a friend of mine #</p>
<p># Jesus is a friend of mine #</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p># Jesus is a friend of mine #</p>
<p>Come on, everybody.</p>
<p>You don't know it? You're banning Jeff from the party? That doesn't seem very Christian.</p>
<p>Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.</p>
<p>I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family.</p>
<p>And, ahem, this is the thanks I get? Shirley, you are a guilt machine.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>And Annie knows a thing or two about guilt, am I right, Jew? Say the whole word.</p>
<p>Jewie? You would never catch a Jehovah's Witness saying "Jewie." </p>
<p>Tell it to the birthday cake you never got.</p>
<p>You know, there's an old Buddhist saying You are not a Buddhist, you are in a cult.</p>
<p>Suck it, Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Guys, everyone's faith is weird.</p>
<p>Let's just not talk about it.</p>
<p>Guys, guys.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, are we really gonna let religion divide us like this? I think there's one thing we can all agree on.</p>
<p>I get 72 virgins in heaven.</p>
<p>No, that we would all like to have Jeff at this party.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>He can't come.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Shirley.</p>
<p>I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you.</p>
<p>And I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to recreate something that you're afraid that you've lost forever.</p>
<p>But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one.</p>
<p>Even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with.</p>
<p>And you can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground, groping another man.</p>
<p>That's what I'm gonna do.</p>
<p>The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.</p>
<p>If this dude doesn't show up, we're definitely going to Applebee's.</p>
<p>Because I'm getting into a fight no matter what today, I'm telling you.</p>
<p>Oh, look who showed up.</p>
<p>Oh, check him out.</p>
<p>Ohh! What's up, dude? No backup today, huh? Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't show up to get their teeth knocked out.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question? Are you perpetually on your way to the gym? Dude, my life is a gym.</p>
<p>Well, what's up? What's up? What's up, man? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Whoa.</p>
<p>Dude, what is that? One sec, these are very expensive.</p>
<p>What is he doing? All right.</p>
<p>Dude, you wear a bracelet? Your name is Mike, right? So? Mike, I'm not gonna fight you.</p>
<p>I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences and make peace.</p>
<p>Me? I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship.</p>
<p>And as much as I hate you and the cast of <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Breakin'</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086998'>Breakin'</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1984&ndash;</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Music</span></span></span></span>, I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do? Oh, no.</p>
<p>What would Shirley do? I think that she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Kick his ass.</p>
<p>Cavalry's here.</p>
<p>Shirts off, boys.</p>
<p>Come on, I'm being punk'd, right? Kick them.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Please, it's Christmas.</p>
<p>It's December 10th.</p>
<p>Ow! Not the moneymaker, not the moneymaker.</p>
<p>Ow! Ow! You're welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you, I get it.</p>
<p>Yes, it is I, Señor Chang.</p>
<p>Shakira, hold this.</p>
<p>So I have finished grading everyone's finals.</p>
<p>And all of you are moving on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Except for Jeff.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It turns out, you -- pause for dramatic effect -- will be seeing me next semester.</p>
<p>No! In Spanish 102, ha-ha-ha! Because he passed, you know.</p>
<p>And I'm the only Spanish teacher.</p>
<p>Yay! I meant about Jeff passing.</p>
<p>You being our Spanish teacher, eh.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Man, Mike got you good.</p>
<p>Actually, that was my present to Jeff.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>I've got a mountain to shred.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, you're a man now.</p>
<p>How does it feel? I got hit in the face, like, four times before you punched me.</p>
<p>Well, some people just don't know how to say thank you.</p>
<p>Pierce, thank you.</p>
<p>And thanks to all of you for showing up and having my back when we fought those fly dancers.</p>
<p>So, uh, ooh! Merry --</p>
<p>No, no, no, holiday.</p>
<p>Actually, I was gonna say, "Merry semester and happy new one." </p>
<p>Switch? Switch, switch, next glass.</p>
<p>Okay, he's running out.</p>
<p>He's running out.</p>
<p># O Christmas Troy, O Christmas Troy #</p>
<p># Thy candles shine so brightly #</p>
<p># O Christmas Troy, O Christmas Troy #</p>
<p># Much pleasure thou canst give me #</p>
<p>Why do you guys do stuff like this? Because it's fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p># The sight of thee at Christmastide #</p>
<p># Spreads hope and gladness Far and wide #</p>
<p># O Christmas Troy, O Christmas Troy #</p>
<p># Thou tree most fair and lovely #</p>
