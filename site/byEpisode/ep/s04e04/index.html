<p>Look, 12:00.</p>
<p>History of Ice Cream class is letting out.</p>
<p>It's as informative as it is delicious.</p>
<p>That class should've been ours.</p>
<p>I hear the final is a sundae bar.</p>
<p>I don't get history.</p>
<p>If I wanted to know what happened in Europe a long time ago, I'd watch Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>That show takes place in a fantasy realm.</p>
<p>This is about the real world.</p>
<p>Not the show.</p>
<p>You need to think before you speak.</p>
<p>I hear this teacher's a real hard-ass.</p>
<p>He's British and has a degree.</p>
<p>I can't have a hard-buns teacher.</p>
<p>I'm starting a business.</p>
<p>When am I supposed to see my family? Ben took his first steps without me.</p>
<p>Quick impression: "Wah." </p>
<p>Who am I? You guys.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>Dead on.</p>
<p>I know The History of Ice Cream would have been fun but not only will this class be much less likely to give us type 2 diabetes, we might actually learn so-- Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Those annoying Germans are back? I thought they transferred after they lost their foosball scholarship.</p>
<p>I heard they were juicing.</p>
<p>No, them leaving would mean Greendale got slightly better, which, as we know, does not happen.</p>
<p>Lukas, Karl, I see you've grown a new douche bag.</p>
<p>My name is Reinhold.</p>
<p>I believe you know my brother, Juergen.</p>
<p>There was some bad blood between you two,ja? Hmm.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>If there is one thing Germans don't do, it's hold a grudge.</p>
<p>Unless we're talking Die Hard 3.</p>
<p>Or the 20th century.</p>
<p>Morning, everyone.</p>
<p>Morning, sir.</p>
<p>I am Professor Cornwallis.</p>
<p>I know what you're all thinking, and the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I am a direct descendant of General Sir Charles Cornwallis who surrendered the British forces at Yorktown.</p>
<p>Was anyone thinking that? No.</p>
<p>History is written by the victors.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know the quote.</p>
<p>What does it mean? According to Oxford University, it means that my 20 years' loyal service there means nothing next to a little slipup with a coed.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>But what it really means is that history can be seen from a multitude of vantage points.</p>
<p>So for your first test on Monday --</p>
<p>Oh, oh, come on.</p>
<p>I'm confused.</p>
<p>When do we get our ice cream? I want to challenge you to look at history from all perspectives.</p>
<p>How would the story read if it was written not by the victors, but by the vanquished? Ja, how indeed? I was recalling a very funny episode of the German version of The Nanny.</p>
<p>Franlein gets a-- It wouldn't translate.</p>
<p>And I still have those pants.</p>
<p>True story.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Oh, we have fun.</p>
<p>Aah! Sorry.</p>
<p>I should've realized that might be startling.</p>
<p>Dr. Ken Kedan, Greater Greendale Mental Health Services.</p>
<p>Kevin, does this gentleman look familiar to you? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>He doesn't.</p>
<p>Kevin? Uh-uh.</p>
<p>His name is Chang.</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>That explains the note.</p>
<p>"Hello, my name is Kevin. I have Changnesia"? What is that?</p>
<p>Not uncommon for victims of memory loss to experience syntactical confusion.</p>
<p>Thus, the inappropriate insertion of his name into an unrelated phrase.</p>
<p>No, he's always dean that.</p>
<p>Once we learned of the connection to Greendale, we realized it'd be the perfect environment for immersive therapy.</p>
<p>What? No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I can't have an unbalanced nut job traipsing around on my campus.</p>
<p>Put that on the rack, put that in the fridge.</p>
<p>Get him out of here.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Your school board already signed off on it.</p>
<p>Kevin is now your responsibility.</p>
<p>Ahhhh! I just felt a disturbance.</p>
<p>Did you have dairy this morning? Could be that.</p>
<p>Or it could be that great evil is nearby.</p>
<p>I'll take a provisional Lactaid.</p>
<p>Won't be needing the Lactaid.</p>
<p>Uh, guys, this is our study room.</p>
<p>Please leave.</p>
<p>And take that mushroom cloud of Drakkar with you.</p>
<p>Why must he hurt so with his words? He's like a less funny Hans Rickles.</p>
<p>I'm not here to argue, Angela Jerk-els.</p>
<p>Beat it.</p>
<p>Oh! Someone must've changed the channel to USA because I just watched a Burn Notice.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Who's Angela Jerk-els? I can assure you, we are here for no reason other than to study.</p>
<p>Our usual off-campus haunt, Der Kaffee Hausen is closed for the shooting of an esoteric art film.</p>
<p>Tomorrow it shall reopen and we shall be out of your heavily product-laden hair.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Jeff, it's just a little table in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Why don't we just let them have it? That's called appeasement.</p>
<p>And everyone knows if you give the Germans something small, like the study room or Austria, they end up wanting something big, like Earth.</p>
<p>Jeff's right.</p>
<p>If there were more people in the world like Annie, we'd all be speaking Vietnamese right now.</p>
<p>That was my war.</p>
<p>I had flashbacks for years.</p>
<p>Pierce, you moved to Canada.</p>
<p>And it was hell.</p>
<p>Those people call ham "bacon." </p>
<p>This is silly.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna walk over there and tell them they are welcome to share our room.</p>
<p>Delightful.</p>
<p>So today, we study in here.</p>
<p>Undtonight, we dine in hell.</p>
<p>Doktor Blitz, Knight of the Atlantis Guild, wielder of the four-pronged trident in "Spawncraft." </p>
<p>How did you know? I recognized your catchphrase: "Tonight we dine in hell!" I'm Spacetimer 8032.</p>
<p>You are Spacetimer 8032? The one and only.</p>
<p>It's wonderful to meet you, brother.</p>
<p>What was that all about? You two seemed pretty chummy.</p>
<p>That man saved my life.</p>
<p>In a video game.</p>
<p>Let me get this as straight as I can get things.</p>
<p>You authorized this? After everything that happened last year? Hear us out.</p>
<p>They offered money.</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to you that this man is a psychopath who may be faking his own Changnesia? Oh.</p>
<p>Now he has me saying it.</p>
<p>Amdeansia.</p>
<p>Amdeansia.</p>
<p>I'm all turned around.</p>
<p>If he is faking, you're welcome to prove it.</p>
<p>We get the money either way.</p>
<p>Uhn! Oh, I will prove it.</p>
<p>And I'll have fun doing it.</p>
<p>Now, what to wear? See? I know those guys were annoying yesterday but aren't you glad we didn't turn it into a whole big macho war thing? You're right.</p>
<p>I can't believe I doubted you.</p>
<p>Hey, what's that sound you make when you see something shocking? That's it.</p>
<p>What are you doing at our table? What happened to Der Kaffee Hausen? Our time in this room yesterday proved more pleasant than expected.</p>
<p>It's got a good energy.</p>
<p>That table is ours.</p>
<p>This room is ours.</p>
<p>You guys need to leave.</p>
<p>Hey, Karl.</p>
<p>Hi, Abed.</p>
<p>I am afraid it is you who must do the making like a tree which is to say leaving.</p>
<p>Security.</p>
<p>You want us to leave? There a problem here? Yeah.</p>
<p>These DUssel-dorks won't leave our study room.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I don't understand any of these puns.</p>
<p>I think I need to learn history.</p>
<p>You have a sign-in sheet? You're asking for our papers? I thought this was America, not Arizona.</p>
<p>We have a sign-in sheet.</p>
<p>Lukas.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should all just go home and see our families and think things through? Looks like the room is theirs.</p>
<p>Shirley, call your babysitter, because this means-- Let me guess.</p>
<p>War? Let the lady finish her sentence.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jeff.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We'd like to sign out Study Room F.</p>
<p>It would appear that in this battle, our bulge was a little bit bigger.</p>
<p>Guten bye-bye.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Don't touch.</p>
<p>Damn them and their perfectly crafted timepieces.</p>

<p>Don't touch.</p>
<p>Damn them and their perfectly crafted timepieces.</p>
<p>What else do you have available? It's like a Darren Aronofsky film.</p>
<p>I'll get this.</p>
<p>My fifth father-in-law was an electrician.</p>
<p>You pick up a thing or two.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Everybody grab me, please! Nobody grab him.</p>
<p>Aah! Pierce, just let go.</p>
<p>You'd like that, wouldn't you? Of the thing, Pierce.</p>
<p>It smells like barbecue.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>We're getting up earlier tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, look at them.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking me in.</p>
<p>We must have been great pals before my Changnesia, huh? Oh, my-- That's it.</p>
<p>You may have fooled that handsome doctor but you can't fool me.</p>
<p>Oh, how convenient.</p>
<p>Showing up here with Changnesia after you staged a coup, almost blew up the school, and locked me in a basement for months.</p>
<p>Without so much as a drop of moisturizer.</p>
<p>I did all that? I mean, Chang did all that? If that's true, then Chang, who is me, deserves to go to jail.</p>
<p>Well, he did.</p>
<p>And you do.</p>
<p>This is the worst thing that's happened to me in my 96 hours of memory.</p>
<p>And that failed ventriloquist's name was Slobodan MiloÃ©eviÃ©.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For the essay portion of your test on Monday, you will be asked to describe a historical battle from the perspectives of both the winners and the losers.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>No dioramas.</p>
<p>Guten luck on the examination.</p>
<p>We will be preparing for it in Study Room F, as in "fictory." </p>
<p>I like the way your old chair cradles mein k'naidels.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>I just made that up.</p>
<p>English is my second language.</p>
<p>Jeff, stop.</p>
<p>It's over.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>These guys are horrible.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Except Karl.</p>
<p>Really, Abed? Karl's not horrible? Even though he took your home? When I was growing up, it was just me and my mom.</p>
<p>I didn't have much of a family, that is, until I met you guys.</p>
<p>So excuse me if I'm not willing to give up the place where we became a family.</p>
<p>So, what are we gonna do? We literally can't get up any earlier.</p>
<p>Many years ago, before the concept of "too soon" existed, there was a show about a bunch of goofy Nazis running a prison camp, and that show was called-- Hogan's <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hogan's Heroes</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058812'>Hogan's Heroes</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1965&ndash;1971</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>War</span></span></span></span>?

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And while, for a latchkey kid with no Jewish friends, it was a bit desensitizing, it still taught me that the lovable misfits always win and the bumbling Germans always lose.</p>
<p>All we need is a clever ruse-- Strike that.</p>
<p>All we need is a ruse.</p>
<p>You had me at "ruse." </p>
<p>That was the last thing I said.</p>
<p>Good thing you said it.</p>
<p>Welcome to Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>What is this? Call it a peace offering.</p>
<p>You won, we lost.</p>
<p>Let's end this dumb war and move on.</p>
<p>Care for some authentic blutwurst? This stuffs the real deal.</p>
<p>We got it down in Little Munich.</p>
<p>It's been banned by the FDA.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>No, Karl.</p>
<p>That blutwurst was probably injected with a laxative to make us pull a Grete Waitz in our trousers.</p>
<p>I promise you, there's nothing gross in this sausage.</p>
<p>It's just pig's blood stuffed into a cow's intestine.</p>
<p>Gott, that must be nearly Idiot.</p>
<p>Do not accept their gifts.</p>
<p>Something is clearly up.</p>
<p>Please, these are just small tokens of our friendship.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Dirndls, blutwurst, luftballons.</p>
<p>A cartoonishly large cake.</p>
<p>This is a ruse.</p>
<p>It is exactly like an episode of Hogan's Villains.</p>
<p>Ruse? This is no ruse.</p>
<p>Just take that large cake back to the study room and enjoy it there.</p>
<p>So there's nothing hiding inside this giant German chocolate cake? Ask Abed.</p>
<p>You can trust him.</p>
<p>He's a friend.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Just solid cake.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Then you wouldn't mind if I cut the cake? Or save it for later.</p>
<p>You don't have to share it.</p>
<p>Shirley stayed up all night baking that for you.</p>
<p>I just used the eggs I would've used for my son's breakfast.</p>
<p>But it would be so easy for me to carve into this cake and serve us all.</p>
<p>Wait! Damn it.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>We thought you were stupider than this.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Should I release the tear gas or has that ship sailed? An excellent attempt, Winger, but we are smarter than you.</p>
<p>And once again, it shall be us who are savoring the smooth and somewhat happy taste of victory.</p>
<p>Beer me, bitte.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>As they say in <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Ferris Bueller</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098795'>Ferris Bueller</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1990&ndash;1991</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span>, "dankeschön." </p>
<p>And as they say in the movie Gotcha: Gotcha.</p>
<p>Busted.</p>
<p>Busted? For what? But there were dozens of students at that Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>But you were the only German students celebrating German culture.</p>
<p>And here at Greendale, that is a big fat no-no.</p>
<p>We frown on anyone celebrating their own cultural heritage.</p>
<p>I mean, if the Hasidic Student Union wants to host a Kwanzaa celebration, you go, Jews.</p>
<p>Hanukkah? No, sir.</p>
<p>It's why I keep a detailed list of every student's race and nationality.</p>
<p>To prevent racism and nationalism.</p>
<p>This is an outrage.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>It's not like you're expelled.</p>
<p>You're just banned from certain campus amenities.</p>
<p>Water fountains, swimming pools.</p>
<p>Most of these are water-based.</p>
<p>Oh, and the study rooms.</p>
<p>I gotta take this.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Dean Pelton.</p>
<p>If I don't offer you a receipt, your education is free.</p>
<p>Chang did what? Oh, cool.</p>
<p>What are we protesting? You guys.</p>
<p>You've been hogging that study room for three years.</p>
<p>Somebody finally stood up to you, and you had them banned.</p>
<p>Why must our people always be the victims? What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Justice! Oh, my God.</p>
<p>This whole time we thought the Germans were the Germans but it turns out, we're the Germans.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>You guys are all siding with the Germans? You realize these guys are, like, contractor-grade tools.</p>
<p>They signed out that room fair and square and then you had to take it too far, like you always do with that room.</p>
<p>Yeah! Damn it! I signed this room out! And I have a final tomorrow! They lost a pen.</p>
<p>Come back in a few hours, we're playing "Dungeons & Dragons." </p>
<p>Yes? I left my notebook.</p>
<p>Come back later.</p>
<p>I'm trying to prove a point.</p>
<p>You're like those guys on Hogan's <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hogan's Heroes</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058812'>Hogan's Heroes</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1965&ndash;1971</span><span class='genres popupList'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>War</span></span></span></span>, the Nazis.</p>
<p>You take that back.</p>
<p>I'm Jewish.</p>
<p>Yeah, Leonard.</p>
<p>Don't call me a Nazi.</p>
<p>You are wearing an SS T-shirt.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>Open 2.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? You, sir, have been bailed out.</p>
<p>We are going to nurse you back to health.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>But why? Why take me back in after everything I did to you? When I heard you had checked into jail, I realized you couldn't be faking.</p>
<p>The real Chang would never have remorse for what he did.</p>
<p>I believe you, Kevin.</p>
<p>Plus, curing Changnesia, that's a human-interest story.</p>
<p>Puts Greendale on the map.</p>
<p>But your health comes second-- Whoop.</p>
<p>First, to the school.</p>
<p>Oh, let's not hug.</p>
<p>Do you mind getting my-- ? Okay.</p>
<p>Probably shouldn't step on it.</p>
<p>I feel guilty eating this cake.</p>
<p>And not for the usual reasons.</p>
<p>This is what happens when a group of people blindly follows a charismatic golden-throated leader.</p>
<p>Are you comparing me to Hitler? Yeah.</p>
<p>There are similarities.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>Nobody's even willing to consider that I might be the Hitler of this group? We were the good guys.</p>
<p>How could everybody think we're the bad guys? We are.</p>
<p>When Karl and I were raiding the Diamond North Caves, I was facing 50 death beetles.</p>
<p>He saved me.</p>
<p>When I had a chance to return the favor, I told him it was solid cake.</p>
<p>You were just following orders.</p>
<p>There's probably a way I can make it up to him.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I'll give him my four-pronged trident.</p>
<p>Why not call it a quadrident? Shh.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>There you people are.</p>
<p>I believe we have something to discuss.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You clever British bastard.</p>
<p>You set this up to teach us a lesson.</p>
<p>What? Making the school pretend to hate us to show us that one man's hero is another man's villain.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>We aren't Nazis.</p>
<p>I tip my cap to you, sir.</p>
<p>Lesson learned.</p>
<p>Are you actually suggesting that a professor at Greendale would set up an elaborate ruse just to teach seven students a lesson? Yes.</p>
<p>That's a Wednesday.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I've made a terrible mistake coming here.</p>
<p>So this wasn't part of the class? Then why are you here? You had a test today, and you all missed it.</p>
<p>F's for everyone.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Maybe it's not too late to get out of my contract.</p>
<p>I really am Hitler.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it's just decided? No vote or anything? I hate this.</p>
<p>I wish there was a way that we could make it up to people.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>We need to make reparations.</p>
<p>We have to start giving back because Greendale has given us so much.</p>
<p>It gave us the study room.</p>
<p>And that study room is our home.</p>
<p>But our home is more than those four walls.</p>
<p>And our family is more than the seven of us.</p>
<p>It's all of Greendale.</p>
<p>And everyone deserves to have what we have.</p>
<p>What do you know? Greendale just got slightly better.</p>
<p>It's good to be back.</p>
<p>Should we go celebrate at Skeeper's? Oh, come on, Shirley.</p>
<p>We all have lives.</p>
<p>There you are.</p>
<p>I am so proud how you stepped up and made amends.</p>
<p>And everyone forgave you.</p>
<p>Because when it comes right down to it, Greendale's a forgiving place.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind the next 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Remember that people can Chang.</p>
<p>People can what? Hmm? Hi, I'm Kevin.</p>
<p>He has Changnesia.</p>
<p>And you know what that sound is.</p>
<p>It's the Troy and Abed podcast.</p>
