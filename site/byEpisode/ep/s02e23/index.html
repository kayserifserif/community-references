<p>No! Stay calm, everybody! No, no, no!</p>
<p>You can't outrun me.</p>
<p>I see you, fat-ass! No, don't shoot me! Guys, please.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't even have a gun.</p>
<p>Isn't this against the rules? There's only one rule, Fat Neil.</p>
<p>The prize goes to the last man standing.</p>
<p>So to speak.</p>
<p>If you were a dude, you'd have my fist up your balls.</p>
<p>Thank you, Annie.</p>
<p>Kick their guns to me.</p>
<p>Kick, don't reach.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Christina Reachy, I said kick.</p>
<p>Annie, take it easy.</p>
<p>You gotta learn to trust people.</p>
<p>Can't you leave me with a little something? We're friends, Annie, remember? We played Dungeons & Dragons together.</p>
<p>That was a game.</p>
<p>This is paintball.</p>
<p>Let's gather round.</p>
<p>Okay, a couple of announcements.</p>
<p>I wanna thank Pistol Patty's Cowboy Creamery for sponsoring our end-of-the-year picnic.</p>
<p>Now, free ice cream and that one guy having a heart attack aren't the only surprises today.</p>
<p>We're gonna end this year with a quick game of Paintball Assassin.</p>
<p>Now, last year's big mistake was way too valuable a prize.</p>
<p>And I've been assured, huh, that this year will be different.</p>
<p>So take it away, Pistol Patty.</p>
<p>Howdy, folks.</p>
<p>There's only one rule: Last man standing gets the prize.</p>
<p>There's your guns.</p>
<p>And here's the prize: One hundred thousand dollars cash.</p>
<p>Go nuts! Ah! I heard you never shoot an unarmed man.</p>
<p>Whoever started that rumor didn't eat my beans.</p>
<p>Then I guess it's lucky for me I'm not unarmed.</p>
<p>Seeing as I'm eating your beans.</p>
<p>Jeff wants to see you.</p>
<p>Yeah? And I want pants.</p>
<p>A lot of people want a lot of things.</p>
<p>It won't hurt to hear him out.</p>
<p>We got a good spot in the library.</p>
<p>As safe as you are here, you'll be safer with us.</p>
<p>I see you! There they go! Math Club's gotten better since last year.</p>
<p>They were practicing while the rest of us went on dates.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I have a plan.</p>
<p>Math Club?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I'm Asian.</p>
<p>You guys Asian? That's pretty racist, man.</p>
<p>That wasn't a no.</p>
<p>I'm coming over.</p>
<p>Don't shoot me, shoot him.</p>
<p>He's white and he's out of ammo.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Don't shoot!</p>
<p>See you, Abed.</p>
<p>Shoot Chang!</p>
<p>He defected to the Math Club.</p>
<p>Math rules! Forget it, just a waste of ammo.</p>
<p>Let's go grab their paint.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm much safer with you guys.</p>
<p>Milady.</p>
<p>What do you want, Jeff?</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Well, what do we all want? Ammo.</p>
<p>How much you got left? A hundred thousand dollars worth.</p>
<p>We're running low too.</p>
<p>Shut up, Abed.</p>
<p>What have you heard about Pierce? Hear he's still alive, near the cafeteria.</p>
<p>I hear he has more paint than a French kindergarten.</p>
<p>Are you proposing we join him? I'm proposing his ammo joins us.</p>
<p>You haven't changed.</p>
<p>You think Pierce has? The guy's been a jerk all year.</p>
<p>He's a jerk because we exclude him.</p>
<p>We exclude him because he's a jerk.</p>
<p>And the last time I checked, you were the last one feeling sorry about it.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for you guys to come around.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<p>I am dead, bro.</p>
<p>I'm dead.</p>
<p>Who wears spurs in paintball? Who the hell are you? The guy that's gonna win.</p>
<p>Come on! Does that guy even go to this school? He's really good-Iooking.</p>
<p>Like network TV good-Iooking.</p>
<p>See how big his guns were? Just marry him.</p>
<p>Paintball is tough this year.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Careful, you can't hit all three of us.</p>
<p>She won't have to.</p>
<p>Hey, Troy.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>I thought you were dead.</p>
<p>I thought you were dead.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>By the power invested in us as deputies, we now pronounce you arrested.</p>
<p>What are you, deputies of the stairwell? Fort Hawthorne.</p>
<p>There's a bounty on your head, my friend.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>My forehead's not that big, right? Hm.</p>
<p>It's not small.</p>
<p>You let Pierce boss you around in exchange for paint pellets? Actually, Jeff, he's been pretty decent in this game so far.</p>
<p>He's created a safe zone where people can rest, eat and pump breast milk.</p>
<p>That sounds very nice of him.</p>
<p>Beats standing around waiting to get picked off by the Black Rider.</p>
<p>Are you talking about the handsome blond cowboy with the big guns? Is that guy a student? Who is he? We call him the Black Rider.</p>
<p>But he's not really riding anything.</p>
<p>Look, I don't name people, Annie.</p>
<p>I'm a deputy.</p>
<p>I deputize.</p>
<p>You have to surrender your guns.</p>
<p>And your drugs.</p>
<p>Drugs.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>My study group.</p>
<p>How long has it been? Five hours.</p>
<p>Too long.</p>
<p>Welcome to Fort Hawthorne.</p>
<p>How is this even possible? It began with a dream, Annie.</p>
<p>A dream and an impulse to hide in the men's room.</p>
<p>I found that people were willing to roll bullets under the door just for the right to take a dump.</p>
<p>By the way, for you guys, taking a dump is on the house.</p>
<p>Or if you prefer, relax and catch a show.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Jeff, I've also got someone more your speed.</p>
<p>Because you're gay.</p>
<p>All right, I think I've seen enough and I'd like my gun back now.</p>
<p>Only Hawthorne personnel can carry weapons inside, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>All right, you got us here, unarmed, at your mercy.</p>
<p>What do you want? We'll discuss over dinner.</p>
<p>You're famished.</p>
<p>Tonight, we feast.</p>
<p>The Twinkies are wonderful tonight.</p>
<p>Give us some space, Miguel.</p>
<p>What if I told you guys I know where to find enough ammo to end this cowardly hiding out? Split the prize seven ways.</p>
<p>So send your goons to get it.</p>
<p>They'd never bring it back.</p>
<p>We trust each other, we're a study group.</p>
<p>That's pretty warm and fuzzy talk coming from you, Pierce.</p>
<p>You've acted like a villain this year.</p>
<p>I have? Yes.</p>
<p>You raped the Duquesne family.</p>
<p>You guys, Pierce is reaching out.</p>
<p>I'm not risking my butt hauling ammo for the guy that has Vicky dancing for Twinkies.</p>
<p>She's a dance major, Jeff.</p>
<p>She loves Twinkies.</p>
<p>And if you ever took the time to get to know her Look, uh, summer starts tomorrow.</p>
<p>For you guys, it means pool parties, dinners, one-night stands.</p>
<p>For me, it means counting down the days till next fall.</p>
<p>Before we go, let me do this for you.</p>
<p>Let me bring us victory.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>To the study group.</p>
<p>To the study group.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>More juice, Miguel.</p>
<p>I hope we find this cache of ammunition soon.</p>
<p>I need to pump.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>You talking about peeing, right? No.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>Look, about Pierce, I feel bad.</p>
<p>I shouldn't put so much effort into It's okay.</p>
<p>I just think the study group is my family, you know? And if we start picking and choosing Where do we stop? I get it.</p>
<p>You're a good kid, and I wanna do my part to help you stay that way.</p>
<p>Benjamin Chang, for your betrayal of the Cheerleaders' Alliance, I sentence you to pretendsies death.</p>
<p>Guys, you don't have to do this.</p>
<p>I betrayed the Math Club for you.</p>
<p>Ready.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I told Trish about Amber.</p>
<p>Aim.</p>
<p>Fire.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Not cool, bitch.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you told me at last year's tryouts.</p>
<p>Ah! Leave the guns.</p>
<p>Whatev.</p>
<p>Who's there? Can I join you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Damn, I'm out.</p>
<p>Give me your gun.</p>
<p>All right, be careful.</p>
<p>Cheerleaders rule! I'll take that.</p>
<p>Who are you? I'm the bad guy.</p>
<p>Stop trying to fluster me with your handsomeness.</p>
<p>You're creepy.</p>
<p>Why is your chest getting all flushed? It's a rash.</p>
<p>I'm allergic to beans.</p>
<p>Look, do you even go to school here? Sorry, I get paid to shoot paintballs, honey, not the breeze.</p>
<p>Lame.</p>
<p>I'll hit you in the foot.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You're dry, sugar.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I'll save you for last.</p>
<p>You won't get the chance.</p>
<p>Unh! You okay? I got a better look at him.</p>
<p>He's not that good-Iooking.</p>
<p>Didn't he shoot you? He tried.</p>
<p>He's a bad shot too? Man, what does this guy have going for him? Pierce loaded your gun with blanks.</p>
<p>No, don't shoot! Why does this keep happening? And what kind of ice cream company does this? Where's the paint from last year? I hid it.</p>
<p>So the school doesn't get destroyed.</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>Oh, hi, Jeff.</p>
<p>We just ran into the Black Rider.</p>
<p>Dean, if you want this game to end, we need firepower.</p>
<p>In there.</p>
<p>The key's in my shorts.</p>
<p>I can get it out, I guess.</p>
<p>Now, this is more like it.</p>
<p>Okay, Black Rider, now let's see who's attractive.</p>
<p>Dude, you have a problem.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Whoa, where you going? To have a conversation with Pierce.</p>
<p>She's pretty awesome today.</p>
<p>What happened? Black Rider.</p>
<p>He wiped out the whole fort.</p>
<p>Then why are you still here? I can't go back out there, this is the only life I know.</p>
<p>Annie? Is that you? Did you get the ammo? Yup.</p>
<p>Hey! What are you doing? Why's Jeff's gun loaded with blanks? Was it? Oh, come on, now.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>So once again, I'm the bad guy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, he got to win last year.</p>
<p>It's a game, Annie.</p>
<p>It's Fine.</p>
<p>It's a game.</p>
<p>Let's play.</p>
<p>Put it in your holster.</p>
<p>Come on, Annie.</p>
<p>You're my favorite, I don't wanna beat you.</p>
<p>I don't want Jeff to be the Put the gun in your holster and let's play the game.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you can shoot me and play without me.</p>
<p>That's this group's favorite thing.</p>
<p>We're always nice to you, Pierce.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Three days ago, I walked in on you guys playing cards without me.</p>
<p>Three days ago.</p>
<p>We weren't playing cards, we were voting.</p>
<p>And you weren't invited because we were voting about you.</p>
<p>What? We were taking a vote on whether we'd invite you back to the group next year.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, it had to be unanimous.</p>
<p>There was one holdout.</p>
<p>One red card.</p>
<p>Pick it up.</p>
<p>Black Rider.</p>
<p>It's Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>I know you've heard of me by now.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He's lying.</p>
<p>Look, if you're half the cool cowboy you pretend to be, you'll respect that we've got a situation playing out here and let us be until it's settled.</p>
<p>Sure thing.</p>
<p>And once it's settled, I'm taking out everybody in this room.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Starting with you, Mr. Insecure.</p>
<p>You think you're good-looking, but you're not.</p>
<p>You're average.</p>
<p>You're just an average-looking guy with a big chin.</p>
<p>What's going on? He's faking it.</p>
<p>Something's wrong.</p>
<p>It's fake.</p>
<p>Last week he did it to get out of letting me have gum.</p>
<p>He's old, it could be real.</p>
<p>It's real.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Argh! The gurgling's a nice touch.</p>
<p>You guys are terrible.</p>
<p>Eh, we warned you.</p>
<p>Buddy, are you all right? You want me to call 911? Sucker! Son of a bitch, seriously? Told you, dude.</p>
<p>I'm the best! You're the worst.</p>
<p>I'm out of the group? You're out of mine! And I'm winning! We've created a monster.</p>
<p>Let's not give ourselves too much credit.</p>
<p>I'm out.</p>
<p>Some old guy pretended to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>Shot me in the gut.</p>
<p>I don't care, that's your problem.</p>
<p>This school sucks.</p>
<p>Well, then why do you go here? I wouldn't go to this toilet with my big sister's toe.</p>
<p>I take a class online.</p>
<p>I was paid to be here and win the game so my boss could keep his money.</p>
<p>You work for the ice cream company? Sweetie, this thing is so much bigger than you can even imagine.</p>
<p>I'm out of here, I got Coldplay tickets.</p>
<p>Coldplay? Too late, bean allergy, you blew it.</p>
<p>Hello? Anybody? Does anyone have an alliance I can join? I'm really loyal.</p>
<p>Am I out?</p>
<p>In formation.</p>
<p>Blue Leader, standing by.</p>
<p>Blue Leader, stand by.</p>
<p>Red 5, standing by.</p>
<p>White Clones, standing by.</p>
<p>On your knees.</p>
<p>No Greendale student can be allowed to win this game.</p>
