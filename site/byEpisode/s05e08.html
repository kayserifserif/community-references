<p>Okay, we'll get an estimate on adding grass to the soccer field.</p>
<p>Good meeting.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff, what time's dinner? Uh, dinner? Jeff, you didn't invite Shirley? Well, it's Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shirley always goes to Elijah's karate practice on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>Part of making sacrifices for my loved ones is not expecting my loved ones to make sacrifices.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I can do tomorrow.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>I'm free on Fridays and Mondays We're not moving it! When Shirley can have dinner, we'll have another dinner, because it's just dinner.</p>
<p>And there's no need to manipulate each other.</p>
<p>You know that's what you do.</p>
<p>You know you're doing it now with that face.</p>
<p>You don't like my face? Aw.</p>
<p>Hello, Save Greendale Committee.</p>
<p>This is David and Bixel.</p>
<p>They're app designers.</p>
<p>They'd like to beta test their latest social-networking app on our campus, which could be good for us.</p>
<p>Look what Facebook did for Harvard, right? Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Bixel and I would like to introduce you to a little app called MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>MeowMeowBeenz let's you say how much you like, who you like, when you like, all from a standard non-boost mobile phone.</p>
<p>Let's see how it works.</p>
<p>Bixel, what did you think of the way the Dean introduced us? I thought he did great.</p>
<p>That's why I'm giving him five MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Well, Bixel, I'm sorry, but I thought his intro was just okay.</p>
<p>That's why I'm gonna give him two out of five MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>My MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>With MeowMeowBeenz, students can rate teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers can rate students.</p>
<p>Everyone and anyone can rate each other.</p>
<p>MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>You know I could I fought for this country, and I know you don't get to pick and choose the parts you fight for, but I know I should go number two soon.</p>
<p>Hurry up! I'm late for Human Rights class.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Why is Starburns carrying Garrett's books? It's like toast bossing crackers around.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess.</p>
<p>Garrett's got three MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>Starburns is a Two.</p>
<p>Are you telling me people are actually using this stupid app? - It's addictively effective.</p>
<p>No, it's effectively stupid.</p>
<p>There already was a rating system in place called "cool people get more," and it was working fine.</p>
<p>MeowMeowBeenz takes everything subjective and unspoken about human interaction and reduces it to explicit, objective numbers.</p>
<p>I've never felt more alive.</p>
<p>As long as you're happy, I'm unsettled.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>What happened to you? I sat on a toilet so long, my feet fell asleep, then I noticed limping was getting MeowMeowBeenz, so I just kind of started committing.</p>
<p>Did you understand a word he said? Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Hey, here you go.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Nobody is gonna down-vote a guy on his birthday.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Are you using MeowMeowBeenz? If you can't kill it, join it.</p>
<p>When you get older, you're gonna see the warning signs.</p>

<p>MeowMeowBeenz is gonna make East Berlin look like Woodstock.</p>
<p>You take my word for that.</p>
<p>Do you own stock in Trivial Pursuit's Baby Boom Edition? Britta.</p>
<p>Please tell me you're not using this app.</p>
<p>Uh, I liked the idea at first, giving a voice to the unheard, but then Annie just told me that the rating system is exponentially weighted.</p>
<p>As your ratings go up, your ratings of other people - become more important.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It just means the more others like you, the more likeable you can make others.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me.</p>
<p>You know who else it made sense to? Say "Hitler" one more time, and I'm giving you a two.</p>
<p>Jeff, are you not registered? The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be to get your number up.</p>
<p>Annie! Listen to yourself.</p>
<p>You're learning its language.</p>
<p>You're letting a video game play you.</p>
<p>I got to set these people straight.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, uh, students of Greendale! We don't have to worship a calculator! There is no formula for people! Oh.</p>
<p>You're punishing me for being alive! That's the general idea, baby.</p>
<p>You're gonna think I'm joking, but you were getting through to me more with mustard on your lip.</p>
<p>Oh, shut up.</p>
<p>He's not kidding, Britta.</p>
<p>I thought I was imagining it.</p>
<p>When you had mustard on your lip, I was more open to your opinion.</p>
<p>Maybe it dilutes or distracts from your excessive intensity.</p>
<p>Maybe it dilutes or distracts from your stupid butt.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>How you doing, Rog? Hey, Charlotte.</p>
<p>I see what you did there.</p>
<p>Vicki, I love this.</p>
<p>Shirley's a Five.</p>
<p>How? - She's nice to people, Jeff.</p>
<p>You know Shirley.</p>
<p>Oh, Vicki, thank you.</p>
<p>Did you just give me four MeowMeowBeenz? Um, I love my four from Vicki.</p>
<p>No! Stop it! I didn't mean it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do know Shirley.</p>
<p>Oh! We should be having brownies.</p>
<p>I'm going to help Shirley.</p>
<p>Not a bad idea for you, Britta.</p>
<p>She could make you a Two again.</p>
<p>Screw your Twos, and screw MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>I know that's your One talking.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Registering for MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>I'm gonna become a Five and expose this thing for the sham it is.</p>
<p>Oh, now you're speaking my language.</p>
<p>That's unintentional, trust me.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Just make sure you know the real reason you're doing something, or you'll fail before you start.</p>
<p>That's actually a good point.</p>
<p>It is? Why? Oh, come on!</p>
<p>So I'm like, "That's two cups," and she's like, "What?" I'm like, "Two cups, balls back, tops off." </p>
<p>All right, Trent, Mulch, Dave, Herpie, Clutch, Dirt Mouth, Rope, Tingles, Cat Woman, Steve.</p>
<p>All right, keep it floppy.</p>
<p>Haul it, ball it, never call it.</p>
<p>Girls are objects.</p>
<p>Yeah! Two MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>Abed was just explaining that the Fives get to choose what setting the air conditioning is on.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Is it me, or are more people wearing gray.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm in a commercial, and someone's about to hand me a Starburst.</p>
<p>Threes and Twos tend to wear neutral colors.</p>
<p>Looking like you want to move up can get you moved down.</p>
<p>Abed, hey.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Those are other Threes.</p>
<p>We talk about how we're glad we're not Twos.</p>
<p>Small talk, guys.</p>
<p>I make small talk now.</p>
<p>Hello, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>I see you decided to join MeowMeowBeenz.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a great tool for living.</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p>You know what you're doing.</p>
<p>You know what you're doing.</p>
<p>I'm watching you, okay? - Mm, mm.</p>
<p>Mm, mm.</p>
<p>Yeah, you'll be watching my hinder, mama, and choking on its billowing plume of highly rated dust.</p>
<p>__ Whoa, whoa, whoa, Fours and above only.</p>
<p>These are snacks for the Fives.</p>
<p>Yeah? You're a two.</p>
<p>Leonard, would you rather a Three serve the Fives food? No.</p>
<p>It is no secret that the Threes and Twos are growing suspicious of the Fours and Fives.</p>
<p>All I know is that it's my birthday.</p>
<p>What if we give these people something to believe in again? - Koogler? - Hey.</p>
<p>I know what you guys think of me, okay? "Hey, it's Koogler." </p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>"He's cool." </p>
<p>"He likes to get laid. He's not that old." </p>
<p>But I'm a Five because I know what the Twos and the Threes need.</p>
<p>What do we all need? Entertainment.</p>
<p>A talent show.</p>
<p>An event where Threes and Twos can rise and fall.</p>
<p>It helps people believe in the system.</p>
<p>Give my spot to someone else.</p>
<p>I don't want to be a Five.</p>
<p>I was happy as a Three.</p>
<p>I'm miserable.</p>
<p>Oh, dear Abed.</p>
<p>So humble.</p>
<p>You people are monsters.</p>
<p>Well, if there's nothing else, then Speak.</p>
<p>Headline items A few Twos broke into a supply closet and stole a box of peanut butter.</p>
<p>The futurization of the campus decor is almost complete.</p>
<p>And a few hours ago, Jeff Winger became a Four.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>__ You there, girl.</p>
<p>How many MeowMeowBeenz? Two! Two? Are you lost, Two? Yes.</p>
<p>Are you lost, Two? I'll escort her to the common area.</p>
<p>You're a Four? I don't recognize you.</p>
<p>He's new Beenz.</p>
<p>Bye-bye, new Beenz.</p>
<p>Threes and Twos must leave building one after 7:00.</p>
<p>Building one after 7:00 is Fours only.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? - How goes the revolution? I can't break a Four.</p>
<p>It's impossible to get any higher without half the Fives in your corner.</p>
<p>They got this thing locked up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they're nervous.</p>
<p>They're hosting a talent show to prove that anyone can be a Five.</p>
<p>If you enter it, you'll be center stage with all eyes on you, and you can tell everyone this isn't democracy.</p>
<p>This is tyranny.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Can you put some mustard I shouldn't have to put mustard on my face for this to make sense.</p>
<p>You know we have to take this system down.</p>
<p>You know I once loved a Two.</p>
<p>Matthew He was my everything.</p>
<p>But numbers change.</p>
<p>I'll keep your secret, new Beenz.</p>
<p>It says you're next.</p>
<p>Now, Jeffrey, I beg you not to take this risk.</p>
<p>You know what they say.</p>
<p>Fives have lives, Fours have chores, Threes have fleas, Twos have blues, and Ones don't get a rhyme because they're garbage.</p>
<p>Craig, I got this.</p>
<p>No! No, please! Not the Outlands! Please! Boo on you! The Fives have spoken! And you, uh, are not very good and -- What? No! Please! I'm just not very good at public speaking and --</p>
<p>Last chance, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Showtime.</p>
<p>My name is Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>I recently became a Four.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, when I was a Two, I didn't actually have any less.</p>
<p>But I did have a lot of crazy friends.</p>
<p>Hey, my name's Tommy Talouca.</p>
<p>I'm from hallway "C." </p>
<p>I'm a Two! I got to get to the cafeteria before they run out of apples! What is with Twos and apples? You're given three kinds of fruit.</p>
<p>Mix it up.</p>
<p>Then you become a Four.</p>
<p>And you get that, uh that Four walk.</p>
<p>You know what I'm talking about? It's like this.</p>
<p>It's like one of these.</p>
<p>And they got a little trail of Twos behind them, and they're like "Hey, is there an apple up there?" Oh, -</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What else is going on? - He's killing it.</p>
<p>Shh! There came a time when I has to a "aks" myself, did I even want to be a Three? Or did I just hate myself for being a Two? I don't know.</p>
<p>All I know is I sure do love them apples! Oh, the Koog "approogs." </p>
<p>That's a five! Yeah! Review.</p>
<p>Review meow meow meow meow meow! Review.</p>
<p>Review meow meow meow meow meow.</p>
<p>Down here, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I get a picture? I want my future kids to know this happened.</p>
<p>I admire your optimism, Garrett.</p>
<p>What the hell? - I don't want to hear it.</p>
<p>I got this far because I need to take Shirley down.</p>
<p>What about everyone else? - Look around you, Britta.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted this.</p>
<p>Fives only, ma'am.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You you think this system's gonna last forever? I'm gonna free people's minds.</p>
<p>I'm a Psych major.</p>
<p>Words are my weapons.</p>
<p>I'm a security guard.</p>
<p>Weapons are my weapons.</p>
<p>Welcome, Fives, to the inaugural fancy future dance.</p>
<p>I'm glad you don't think making Jeff a Five was a mistake like everybody else.</p>
<p>I believe in taking risks.</p>
<p>Yeah! Jeff's really cool.</p>
<p>Couldn't help but notice that Shirley didn't clap with the rest of you after my performance.</p>
<p>Is she always so different? If you talk to me, I can't concentrate on the dance moves.</p>
<p>You don't believe the rumors, do you, Koogler, that Jeff manipulated his way to the top? Shirley, I can hear what you're saying.</p>
<p>You're trying to manipulate someone into thinking I'm manipulative.</p>
<p>I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>No one ever knows what you're talking about because you never say what you mean.</p>
<p>Do you want to have this conversation, or do you want to just keep flexing your veiny arms and throwing out apples? Tranquility is advancement.</p>
<p>A happy Three is a future Four.</p>
<p>Twos and Threes, you're accepting a life you don't have to live! Stand up for yourselves! Really? Ugh, fine.</p>
<p>Give me that.</p>
<p>Hey! You're all alive! You are all alive! Look at the mustard on my face, but listen to my words.</p>
<p>You're one of the angriest, most vindictive You're the angry one, because the rules got changed on you, Winger.</p>
<p>You can't just be cool and be in charge now.</p>
<p>No, you have to gossip and give out food - and make people feel guilty.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>I bust my ass making a world full of selfish idiots - remember my name! - Fine.</p>
<p>Call it hard work, but don't tell me the system measures who's nice.</p>
<p>Actually, it kind of does.</p>
<p>Security, banish them to the Outlands with the rest of the Ones! - Oh, no! - Ow! - Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>No! No! Ladies and gentlemen, please put your tray tables in their party positions. So sayeth Captain Koogler.</p>
<p>Actually, keep the tray tables where they are, Koogler.</p>
<p>The rule of the Fives is over! Long live the review-lution! - No! - That comes down? - Okay, okay, all right, all right.</p>
<p>Whoa! - Happy? - Are you happy? Look, I knew you couldn't go to that stupid dinner.</p>
<p>That's why I didn't invite you.</p>
<p>It's nice to be invited anyway.</p>
<p>Sure, if you're a control freak.</p>
<p>Oh, and you clearly hate control.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I guess it's easy to pretend that you don't when you got it.</p>
<p>You'd think we'd be better friends because we're both such big fans of the same thing.</p>
<p>You there! Ones! You are permitted back indoors by decree of Britta, the mother of Ones.</p>
<p>And do I hear correctly that as a Five, you felt you could park in handicap spots? Well, you see, that's just part of the Koogler style.</p>
<p>It's human crap style.</p>
<p>Rate him! Okay, well, that's low.</p>
<p>All Fives must be cleansed of their Five filth and reduced to oneness.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Hey, Shirley.</p>
<p>I'm not a Five anymore.</p>
<p>I'm a one like everyone else.</p>
<p>I'm like everyone else.</p>
<p>Who's next? All right, time to pull the plug.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Oh, great mother of Ones, mustard-faced savior, there is still a Five hiding among us that has not been cleansed.</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>All Fives were reduced to oneness in the great purge of about two minutes ago.</p>
<p>This Five cheats.</p>
<p>It never registered, yet was given a five from outside the system.</p>
<p>Behold The MeowMeowBeenz app.</p>
<p>Its beta test ended days ago.</p>
<p>It's now available in the app store 99 cents.</p>
<p>Five stars.</p>
<p>This five lied to us, used us, judged us, yet exempts itself from judgment.</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure it's selling our information to spammers because I am getting a lot more email, and trust me, my penis needs no enlargement.</p>
<p>So how do you cleanse a Five that's unregistered? Delete it.</p>
<p>By the way, guys, it's a Saturday.</p>
<p>Um, you're all in school for nothing.</p>
<p>Go home and get some sleep.</p>
<p>No! No.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>No, don't go! Where are you going? No.</p>
<p>Attention, Greendale.</p>
<p>I'd like to propose we basically forget everything that happened over the last few days.</p>
<p>And I don't anticipate a lot of pushback on that.</p>
<p>I think we're all pretty embarrassed.</p>
<p>Hey, there.</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>So I was thinking about checking out this new restaurant tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, that's sweet, but I can't tonight.</p>
<p>Not even takeout? We could eat in the study room.</p>
<p>Oh, I think I have time for that.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>What? I'm not gonna take it off.</p>
<p>I still got two days left on the rental.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, a film comes along that takes a serious look at higher education.</p>
<p>This is not one of them.</p>
<p>Gentlemen Assume the party.</p>
<p>This summer fun has a new name.</p>
<p>Koogler? - Koogler! - Koogler.</p>
<p>Koogler! Koogler! Koogler! Koogler! Hope you don't mind if I play through.</p>
<p>Hammer Road Pictures invited you to meet the man the myth I'm photocopying my rear end.</p>
<p>the Koogler.</p>
<p>Koogler.</p>
<p>I guess I have what you might call an aversion to education.</p>
<p>Do you even have a career plan? Yeah, uh, does getting laid count? No! Mitchell D. Hurwitz is Koogler Rated "R."</p>
