<p>Okay, you can hear me? Okay.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>I'm here to kick off the first day of a new tradition at our school called Green Week.</p>
<p>What? First, we give a month to black history, now seven days on the Irish.</p>
<p>All this week, Greendale College is becoming so Earth-smart that we're changing our name to Envirodale.</p>
<p>But we were already called Greendale.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there's also going to be a free rock 'n' roll concert by a certain band called <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Green Day</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1554564'>Green Day</a></span><span class='years'>&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>composer</span><span class='tag prof'>actor</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369'>tt1055369</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465602'>tt0465602</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145660'>tt0145660</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1956620'>tt1956620</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>That make you happy? No, not really.</p>
<p>We need to re-do these.</p>
<p>We printed 5000.</p>
<p>Well, print 5000 more.</p>
<p>I'm trying to save a planet here.</p>
<p>Pencils down.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>I wasn't I want you all to write a one-page essay, in español entitled, "Annie's Mistake." </p>
<p>Why doesn't Annie have to write it? Okay, two pages, entitled: "The Consequences of Questioning Authority." </p>
<p>This is Spanish.</p>
<p>I know how to say "hello," "tomorrow" and tables are female.</p>
<p>That's the only Spanish you taught us.</p>
<p>Oh! Six pages on ignorance.</p>
<p>Guys, put your hands down.</p>
<p>Señor Chang, please continue.</p>
<p>We respect your authority.</p>
<p>Thank you, Britta.</p>
<p>Twenty pages on ass kissing.</p>
<p>Due on Monday.</p>
<p>This Monday? If Señor Chang gets any crazier, he's gonna win the Grammy award.</p>
<p>I've already reported him to the dean.</p>
<p>He said they've been trying to fire him for years but nobody wants his job.</p>
<p>I can't write a 20-page paper.</p>
<p>I got a presentation in Marketing.</p>
<p>And public speaking gives me the nervous sweats.</p>
<p>I can help you with that.</p>
<p>I accept.</p>
<p>That's how messed up things are.</p>
<p>Well, we're screwed too.</p>
<p>We're three days behind on a Biology lab.</p>
<p>Troy's afraid of I'm not afraid, Abed.</p>
<p>I choose not to be around rats because they are unpopular.</p>
<p>Same goes for centipedes and lakes.</p>
<p>There's only one solution.</p>
<p>Someone has to go to Chang and talk to him.</p>
<p>I vote we all look at Jeff at the same time.</p>
<p>In a way, all of you are right.</p>
<p>What was I tuning out? You have to get Chang to call off this homework.</p>
<p>You're the one with the silver tongue.</p>
<p>Yeah, go tongue Chang.</p>
<p>What makes you think I could convince Chang if I can't even convince you not to make me do it? Jeff does raise a good point.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>You are convincing.</p>
<p>You could do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want me to risk the C that I'm pulling in that psycho's class by putting myself on his radar? I mean, that guy goes any more nuts, he's gonna win a Grammy.</p>
<p>You are hilarious.</p>
<p>That's very funny.</p>
<p>What is it, the chair? How do you gonna keep pulling a C in that psycho's class if he keeps assigning this much work? Because I have you guys.</p>
<p>Well, guess what, handsome hobo? Your gravy train's leaving the station.</p>
<p>Ignore what she's doing.</p>
<p>We are serious.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll do it.</p>
<p>But when you find my body, don't believe the suicide note.</p>
<p>This better not awaken anything in me.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Okay, what's this about now? We're Greene Daeye.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What do you want, Winger? You complaining about the homework on behalf of the class? Can I ask you a personal question, Señor Chang? Okay, Freud.</p>
<p>Sure, you try to penetrate my psychological armor and you Did your wife leave you? Holy How'd you know? Well, when you pick juries, you learn to read the little stuff.</p>
<p>Same shirt twice in one week.</p>
<p>Teaching us the word esposa means "liar." </p>
<p>A picture of you with a woman with a Post-it note dialogue balloon above her head that says, "Enjoy it while it lasts." </p>
<p>We met at a salsa club.</p>
<p>And, um, she loved the way I danced.</p>
<p>But, I mean, you know how it goes.</p>
<p>You get a job, you stop salsa dancing.</p>
<p>Of course I know.</p>
<p>You make no mistake about this, Winger.</p>
<p>I pleasured that woman greatly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You look like you would have to.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised you said that.</p>
<p>I like you, Winger.</p>
<p>Pickled bull testicle? Are you offering or collecting? Troy, sing.</p>
<p>The assignment is to train a rat to a song.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Everybody shut up.</p>
<p>I'll kick all your asses, but you all have to come up here.</p>
<p>Dude, you are gonna be fine.</p>
<p>You just have to move on.</p>
<p>And if you hang out with me sometime, you will see how great single life can be.</p>
<p>Yeah? Yeah.</p>
<p>What about tonight? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oh, shoot.</p>
<p>My Spanish study group has to get together every night now.</p>
<p>You have been really letting us have it with this homework.</p>
<p>I really have, haven't I? Yeah.</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>For my new buddy, Jeff, essay cancelled.</p>
<p>Shh-clacky.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>That is fantastic.</p>
<p>Everybody will be so happy.</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh.</p>
<p>I didn't say everybody.</p>
<p>It's for my new friend Jeff.</p>
<p>I mean, you're the one coming out with me, right? Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I suppose that will put you in an unenviable, uncomfortable position.</p>
<p>Here's your jacket.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Awesome, great.</p>
<p>Is there a rat in here? I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>El Tigre.</p>
<p>Well, did you talk to Chang? Yeah, but it didn't do any good.</p>
<p>My still head hurts from the yelling.</p>
<p>My pupils are more sensitive to light because he yelled at me so much.</p>
<p>Oh, well, now I feel bad that we made you do that.</p>
<p>Maybe we can help with your essay.</p>
<p>Oh, that's okay.</p>
<p>I'm working on mine by myself.</p>
<p>You could do my homework next time.</p>
<p>See you in class.</p>
<p>He's hiding something.</p>
<p>Britta, Jeff suffered for us.</p>
<p>Give him a little credit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can be pretty cold.</p>
<p>Troy? Damn.</p>
<p>Here comes Abed.</p>
<p>He needs my help.</p>
<p>I gotta get out of here.</p>
<p>Troy? You guys seen a rat? Troy knocked over <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Fievel</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090633'>An American Tail</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1986&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Adventure</span><span class='tag genre'>Animation</span><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span>'s cage and he escaped.</p>
<p>Oh, Abed, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>He probably found more rats and is very happy living with them.</p>
<p>Try to join the rest of us in reality, Britta.</p>
<p>I believe that, uh, fusing brownies with the, uh, Internet is going to create the next Napster for brownies.</p>
<p>Yawn! Can't I just write it on cards? No.</p>
<p>Do you know anybody who reads from cards? No.</p>
<p>No, you don't, and that's why.</p>
<p>Also, you might consider a darker top.</p>
<p>Note taken.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't lock your knees.</p>
<p>Never lock your knees.</p>
<p>You know what happens when you lock your knees? You die.</p>
<p>Second, when you wanna drive home a point, hand them a sandwich.</p>
<p>Try it.</p>
<p>Hand them a sandwich.</p>
<p>See? Hand them a sandwich.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Except that you're You just dropped the sandwich as opposed to handing it to them.</p>
<p>Handing the palm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Try attention-grabbing words to wake up the audience, such as: Multiple orgasm.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>I don't think that would fit into my message.</p>
<p>Maybe we should focus more on Whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, and about these filler words of yours.</p>
<p>I mean, nobody wants to buy brownies from somebody that says "um" and "like." </p>
<p>I have a method for fixing that.</p>
<p>From the top.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>These brownies are, uh, uh! They, um um! These brownies are delicious.</p>
<p>They taste like, like.</p>
<p>That's not a filler word.</p>
<p>Whatever, valley girl.</p>
<p>The difference between usted and tu is a matter of formality.</p>
<p>You are old.</p>
<p>You are ugly.</p>
<p>No, you're not.</p>
<p>Thanks, sir.</p>
<p>Shakira.</p>
<p>Shakira.</p>
<p>What's up? You are dirty.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Still formal but plural because while both are dirty, neither are my friends.</p>
<p>Okay? And on another subject, hope you guys are working hard on your essays.</p>
<p>That's gonna be 30 percent of your grade.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Jeff already turned in his essay.</p>
<p>Great job.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>As soon as you turn in your essays on Monday, there's gonna be a big-ass quiz, so study hard.</p>
<p>Class dismissed.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Crazy night last night, man.</p>
<p>That was crazy.</p>
<p>When you go out with me, it gets crazy.</p>
<p>That's the Winger guarantee.</p>
<p>Dude, let's do it again.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to, it's just the quiz, you know? Study, study.</p>
<p>Well, how about this: Bling.</p>
<p>A-plus.</p>
<p>Nice work, Winger.</p>
<p>I knew I could do it if I applied myself.</p>

<p>Cherry daiquiri.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>You devious clump of overpriced fabric and hair product.</p>
<p>Speaking as one of the meek, soon as I inherit the Earth, you dead.</p>
<p>You got a weird forehead.</p>
<p>We're all very disappointed.</p>
<p>All right, dial it back a little, Britta.</p>
<p>If anyone should be disappointed, it's me.</p>
<p>What kind of a group threatens to kick someone out unless he helps them? What kind of a person is asked to help other people and then helps himself? Helps himself? I don't like being talked to that way.</p>
<p>He's using fake outrage to justify leaving.</p>
<p>Fake outrage? Justify my? Yeah, that's it, I'm out of here.</p>
<p>Are you breaking up with the group? That's what you guys want.</p>
<p>I've been divorced seven times.</p>
<p>Don't answer your phones and bury all your money in the backyard.</p>

<p>Adorable.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>"And the saleswoman had manzanas gigantes." </p>
<p>Ruined it.</p>
<p>Imagine being married to him? Seven times.</p>
<p>Seven different women agreed to marry that guy.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>I'm so alone.</p>
<p>I'm so lonely I wanna die.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>It Come on.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>I just miss her so much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>This is so stupid.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it's fine, it's just Buddy, you know I'm dumb.</p>
<p>I can see that you're hurting but I have to get to Accounting.</p>
<p>It's not like I'm hitting strip clubs with Professor Whitman.</p>
<p>You better not be.</p>
<p>What? All I ask is for you to keep filling the void in my soul.</p>
<p>I'll have to think of something.</p>

<p>That's mine.</p>

<p>I'm gonna write it on some cards.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What's up? Just got your text, man.</p>
<p>Wanna hang out? Because if you don't, I will fail you.</p>
<p>Actually, I had an idea for an extra-credit project.</p>
<p>We've been asked to dedicate our first song to "Señor and Señora Chang." </p>
<p>She said she didn't wanna talk to me.</p>
<p>I didn't tell her you wanted to talk.</p>
<p>The estimation of market value of brownies has -- I, uh -- Target group --</p>
<p>Ms. Bennett, I'm afraid I have to ask you to put down the cards.</p>
<p>Uh, I -- uh, they are wonderful.</p>
<p>We all love brownies.</p>
<p>They're delicious.</p>
<p>If you love brownies, you love life.</p>
<p>Orgasmically delicious.</p>
<p>Here's brownie!</p>
<p>God, he's on my leg! He's on my leg! Disgusting.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What's Chang doing? He's getting a refill on his void.</p>
<p>I got an A on my presentation and a lot of the credit goes to Pierce.</p>
<p>And I had a great sandwich.</p>
<p>We found the stupid rat and Abed's gonna shut up about it.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>I have something to say.</p>
<p>I've been a horrible husband and I've been a horrible teacher.</p>
<p>And I'd like to thank my student, Jeff Winger, for showing me that and helping me fix my marriage.</p>
<p>No more 20-page essays due on Monday.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Although, Winger, you should write a one-page essay called: "Taking Advantage of the Emotionally Vulnerable." </p>
<p>Boo-yah.</p>
<p>You did that for us? Mm.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>I thought hanging out with you guys was the worst way to pass Spanish.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Well, we're the best.</p>
<p>Jeff, I'm sorry I called you a handsome hobo.</p>
<p>If you need help with that essay, you can rejoin the group.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>What are you guys talking to me for? You go dance.</p>
<p>I know your secret.</p>
<p>I know about the chair.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What model did you get? It's the Tsunami 3000 Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>You? The Devil's Drench XJ11.</p>
<p>This is gonna be awesome.</p>
<p>Establish base camps.</p>
<p>What part of the library do you want? North east is closest to the drinking fountain, which is the All right, guys, are we gonna do this thing? Pierce, I hope that's the tiny gun that you throw at us to confuse us while you grab the giant gun taped to your back.</p>
