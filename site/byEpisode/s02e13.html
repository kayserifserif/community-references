<p>Hey, Buzby, how are you today? Not so great, Bumbleton.</p>
<p>I have a ton of pollen to collect, but I'm really tired.</p>
<p>Flying a little low? Maybe you should get high.</p>
<p>Who's this? This is Drugs.</p>
<p>Aren't Drugs bad? No way.</p>
<p>Drugs are like special honey.</p>
<p>They give you a buzzzz.</p>
<p>Don't call me honey, honey.</p>
<p>Pierce, Drugs doesn't say that.</p>
<p>You know, I don't say anything, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, I thought this show was about drug awareness.</p>
<p>Who's gonna be aware of a character that has no lines? Also, I noticed on page 15 I get flushed down a toilet.</p>
<p>Consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p>Annie, question.</p>
<p>Does marijuana help people work faster? I thought it made them custom-paint their vans and solve mysteries.</p>
<p>Are you sure that my costume was on backwards? Somehow, I felt more confident before.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>I don't think my character would say "tripping balls." </p>
<p>That's not a question.</p>
<p>I don't think my character would say "tripping balls," okay? Let's remember why we're doing this.</p>
<p>If our work helps one kid make better choices, then it will all be worth it.</p>
<p>I wish I had seen a show like this.</p>
<p>Might have helped me avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>We're happy to do this for you.</p>
<p>But my school had plenty of shows like this and I think sitting through them drove me to drugs.</p>
<p>You don't respond to anything appropriately.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Dean dong.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>I'm just checking in to see how the Greendale Anti-Drug Players are doing.</p>
<p>I talked to the guidance councilor at San Ramon Middle School.</p>
<p>There's gonna be at least 50 at-risk rug rats coming here tomorrow for your big world premiere.</p>
<p>That's terrific.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>With any luck, we'll get rid of all those Charleston Chews in the vending machines.</p>
<p>Dean Pelton, were you hoping to participate in the show? Oh, I would love to, Annie.</p>
<p>But as you can see from my outfit, I have plans.</p>
<p>So off to the airport Ramada.</p>
<p>How come he gets a front stinger? Do you think bees eat their own honey?</p>
<p>I'm sure they've at least tasted it.</p>
<p>This guy keeps texting me.</p>
<p>You don't like him? I don't like flirting in text.</p>
<p>That's like saying you don't work by electric light.</p>
<p>You want an active sex life, part of it's texting.</p>
<p>I don't remember asking your opinion.</p>
<p>Can't talk now.</p>
<p>Shirley, since I might be the father of your unborn child I made you a mix tape.</p>
<p>I hope you like Johnny Gill.</p>
<p>And since you probably don't have a cassette player, here's a list of used ones on Craigslist.</p>
<p>Britta, are you walking out of this room? Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, you know you're gonna have to acknowledge him eventually.</p>
<p>I don't know who you're talking about.</p>
<p>Chang.</p>
<p>I don't know who you're talking about.</p>
<p>He doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Ooh! I'm sorry.</p>
<p>A word? Mm-hm.</p>
<p>I don't know if you know this, but I did TV commercials for Hawthorne Wipes, family business, in the '50s.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>I was kind of the Gerber baby of moist towelettes.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>That's great, Pierce.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I've done a lot of acting workshops.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>I do physical comedy, funny dances, foreign accents.</p>
<p>Accents? Name any country.</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>There are many tools I can bring to the table that I think the script may be wasting.</p>
<p>Do you know what I think is really great about this show? The only real star of it is the message.</p>
<p>Right, of course.</p>
<p>Is the message Jeff Winger? He's on every page of this thing, and I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>Britta left her phone.</p>
<p>She's getting a text message.</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It's from Marcus.</p>
<p>"I'll be at the show tomorrow night. Can't wait to see you. Are you really wearing a cat costume?"</p>
<p>Well, Marcus, you are in luck.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Dragging Britta kicking and screaming into 1997.</p>
<p>What'd you say?</p>
<p>"There's not much to the cat costume. But can't wait to show you what's underneath." </p>
<p>How could you think that's a good idea? I got a better question.</p>
<p>How could it not be a great idea? Thanks.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Wha? Pierce, what are you doing here? Never mind that.</p>
<p>There's a rapist in the hallway.</p>
<p>That's my landlord.</p>
<p>And if he wanted to rape you, you'd be raped.</p>
<p>Did you follow me? Let me answer your question with two of my own.</p>
<p>What are you doing in an apartment above Dildopolis? And when did they open a second location? This is where I live.</p>
<p>It just happens to be above a marital aid store.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>Aren't everyone's parents rich? Well, I'm not speaking to my parents.</p>
<p>After my breakdown, my mom wanted to put the problem behind us and I wanted to deal with it, so I went to rehab and she cut me off.</p>
<p>What are you living on? I saved.</p>
<p>Every penny from babysitting, every birthday check.</p>
<p>Every dollar from the period fairy when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I guess I thought it would last longer.</p>
<p>Excuse me, what's a period fairy? The fairy that gives you a dollar every time you get your period.</p>
<p>Does she still come? Pierce.</p>
<p>You know, you and I are very much alike, Annie.</p>
<p>We're both realists.</p>
<p>We're both cute.</p>
<p>And we'd both rather die than let someone else control us.</p>
<p>I see the point of this place now.</p>
<p>This crap hole is a monument to self-reliance.</p>
<p>I found the drapes in a dumpster.</p>
<p>Can you believe it? Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, I wanna help, Annie.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, Pierce.</p>
<p>Come on, now.</p>
<p>I'm not taking money from you.</p>
<p>It's not mine.</p>
<p>It's yours.</p>
<p>You've earned it for being strong.</p>
<p>It's going to drop into your hands from out of nowhere because I was never here.</p>
<p>I'm only taking this because I'm worried about making rent and the procedure for selling eggs takes weeks.</p>
<p>You save your eggs for a rainy day, and I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Pierce? Hey, why did you follow me here today? Oh, it was nothing.</p>
<p>It seems sort of pointless now.</p>
<p>I guess it was to talk about the play.</p>
<p>And who cares if I don't have any lines? You know what, you should do that line you improvised.</p>
<p>"Don't call me honey, honey"? Yeah, that's it, you should do that.</p>
<p>You were the Gerber baby of moist towelettes, right? Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I was.</p>
<p>And action.</p>
<p>Hello, I'm Cornelius Hawthorne.</p>
<p>One rainy day, my son Pierce and I were taking a stroll when I discovered the cleansing power of moist cotton fresh from the field.</p>
<p>Isn't that right, son? It sure is.</p>
<p>It sure is, Dad.</p>
<p>Pierce, knock it off.</p>
<p>I want to be in the commercial too, father.</p>
<p>Well, then you should've done better in your damn audition.</p>
<p>What's your name, son? Nigel.</p>
<p>You're a good boy, Nigel.</p>
<p>Your father is a lucky man.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, remember, the most important thing is to have fun.</p>
<p>The second is to know all your lines and not mess up a thing.</p>
<p>Actually, flip those.</p>
<p>Here we go, guys.</p>
<p>I took the liberty of juicing up some of our bits.</p>
<p>Um, but -- You can't just revise Annie's script.</p>
<p>And who uses Wite-Out anymore? Why don't we look over Pierce's changes and see if they improve things? Hey, Crayon, do you know where I can get some drugs? I need them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can get them anywhere.</p>
<p>Anywhere?</p>
<p>I'm here.</p>
<p>Zabadazooey.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem to hurt anything, so let's get into costume and break a stinger.</p>
<p>For the bees.</p>
<p>Annie, uh, I don't feel comfortable with the "zabadazooey" line.</p>
<p>The one you wrote? I got it.</p>
<p>Let's give Jeff the zabadazooey line and I'll come in with "good one." </p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's more in my voice.</p>
<p>I'm sure Jeff is gonna reject that idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're probably right.</p>
<p>You're the producer.</p>
<p>By the way, is this your pen? I think I put it back in my pocket after I wrote you that check yesterday.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>I'll give it to you later.</p>
<p>I'll talk to Jeff.</p>
<p>Also, I think it'd be better for my character if I wear his leather jacket.</p>
<p>Okay, welcome to Greendale's Drug Awareness Show! Okay, our volunteers are handing out drug-free baseballs! Huh? Next time you think about drugs, think about baseball instead.</p>
<p>You can't ignore me forever.</p>
<p>Okay, you probably can.</p>
<p>I don't know why you want to.</p>
<p>My nephew Marcus actually goes to San Ramon Middle School and he's coming to see the show.</p>
<p>Marcus? Your nephew? He's 14.</p>
<p>I actually thought he didn't even like me.</p>
<p>But he texted me and he said, "Can't wait to see you. I've been looking forward to this. You are the coolest aunt in the world." </p>
<p>I hope that I don't let him down.</p>
<p>You'll be great.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It's eight, an equal sign and a greater than symbol? Let me see.</p>
<p>You better get changed.</p>
<p>I'll hang onto your stuff for you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Abed, we screwed up.</p>
<p>You know that text we sent? It was to Britta's nephew.</p>
<p>He sent her an emotipenis.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do? Fine.</p>
<p>Screw you, Abed.</p>
<p>I can fix this.</p>
<p>"Marcus, I made a mistake. I texted the wrong person last night." </p>
<p>"You called me by name. It wasn't a mistake. Don't be afraid." </p>
<p>Screw you, Abed.</p>
<p>"I was drunk. We can't do this." </p>
<p>"I'm drunk too. On lust." </p>
<p>There's a picture.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That's disappointing.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Who does that? That's Bees, you're up.</p>
<p>Cool cats, you're on deck.</p>
<p>Aren't drugs bad?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Drugs are like special honey.</p>
<p>They give you a buzzzz.</p>
<p>Don't call me honey, honey.</p>
<p>Are you ignoring me because I'm Korean? You're Chinese.</p>
<p>Oh, there's a difference? Shh! It's because you're crazy.</p>
<p>There's something wrong with you.</p>
<p>And the idea that I was with you means there's something wrong with me.</p>
<p>And if this baby If you have any humanity at all, you will not make me think about it.</p>
<p>Shirley, funeral.</p>
<p>Well, that answers my question.</p>
<p>Jeff Winger is sexy even in a coffin.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm here.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be on-stage.</p>
<p>I was looking for a lighter.</p>
<p>What are you wearing? This is a funeral.</p>
<p>I got this, Annie.</p>
<p>Uh, I can't believe Fluffy's dead.</p>
<p>I know I'm green, but I feel blue.</p>
<p>Look, it's Drugs with a crazy wig and sparklers.</p>
<p>Pokémon! I don't think that's right, Drugs.</p>
<p>Nobody asked you, Crayon.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.</p>
<p>Look what you've done.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Well, look what I'm doing now.</p>
<p>It smells like something died in here.</p>
<p>Should we get the dean, call in a bomb threat? Should we set off the sprinklers? It's not that big a deal.</p>
<p>The kids are into it.</p>
<p>I don't think they're getting the message.</p>
<p>Do kids ever seem like they're getting the message? I think it's sinking in.</p>
<p>It's your call.</p>
<p>And he's about to get flushed down a toilet in the next scene.</p>
<p>And he'll be done.</p>
<p>I wish I had never even met Drugs.</p>
<p>Who invited the nerd from the beehive?</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Drugs made you.</p>
<p>How about you leave, Drugs? They want more.</p>
<p>I gotta go back out there.</p>
<p>But, Pierce, you were flushed.</p>
<p>That was the story.</p>
<p>That's what's supposed to happen.</p>
<p>Being flushed doesn't mean you're dead.</p>
<p>I could be a floater.</p>
<p>A floater is when you have a number two I know what a floater is, Pierce.</p>
<p>It just wouldn't make any sense in the flow of the show.</p>
<p>And it sends a mixed message.</p>
<p>Know what I think is a mixed message? Yesterday you couldn't pay your rent, and today you can.</p>
<p>Come on, Annie.</p>
<p>You and I are alike.</p>
<p>We're independent, we need each other.</p>
<p>Bzzz.</p>
<p>Getting rid of Drugs was a great "ibee-a." </p>
<p>I'm flying higher than I ever have, thanks to not Drugs.</p>
<p>Argh! Chuck it at his nuts!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Ow! Hey! Hey! I'm back.</p>
<p>Ain't no party without Drugs.</p>
<p>I love you, Drugs.</p>
<p>Yo, pass it this way.</p>
<p>We want Drugs! Listen to that, Dad.</p>
<p>They're high on me.</p>
<p>I'm a god.</p>
<p>We want Drugs! We want Drugs! Where's that Nigel now? And I haven't even used my penis material yet.</p>
<p>Pierce, enough.</p>
<p>We're going back to the original script and doing some damage control.</p>
<p>Damage? The only damage is me blowing the roof off the universe.</p>
<p>I am not letting you go back on that stage.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I won't be visiting you late at night anymore with a generous spirit.</p>
<p>You sick, sick, sad old man.</p>
<p>This is why I didn't wanna take money from my parents.</p>
<p>I don't want anybody pulling my strings.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, is he giving you money? Not anymore.</p>
<p>Pierce bought his way in.</p>
<p>Annie sold out her message.</p>
<p>You've been indulging this maniac? Yes, I've been indulging this maniac.</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p>Fired? Next time I'm at Dildopolis, I will not be coming upstairs to say hi.</p>
<p>The only reason we did this was for you and your stupid ideals.</p>
<p>It turns out you don't even have any.</p>
<p>We supported you, Annie.</p>
<p>Yeah, Annie, you're fired.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Here's the situation.</p>
<p>We've got 50 at-risk pre-teens armed with baseballs, chanting for drugs, who just spent intermission eating nothing but Charleston Chews.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>Hope you can top Act I, is all I'm saying.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>Should we bail? Works for me.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Listen to those kids.</p>
<p>We just created The least we can do is hit the reset button and get that number down to average.</p>
<p>That's a suicide mission.</p>
<p>Did someone say crazy person? No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, I heard it.</p>
<p>We want Drugs! We want Drugs! Greetings, you little snots.</p>
<p>You're not Drugs.</p>
<p>Oh, but I am.</p>
<p>Disappointed? Did you expect me to stay the same forever? Because that's not what Drugs does, baby! I'm gonna deep-fry your dog and eat your mama's face.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna wear your little brother's skin like pajamas.</p>
<p>I control your lives and there is nothing you can do.</p>
<p>Let's kill him.</p>
<p>Oh, bring it on, Bow Wow.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Ah! Is that all you got? I gotta tell you, this is the greatest chemical-dependency program I have ever watched.</p>
<p>The way you got the kids to think that they needed drugs.</p>
<p>And then having them realize that dependence was the enemy.</p>
<p>That the price was just too high.</p>
<p>Genius.</p>
<p>So now that the show is over, what is the plan for these bee costumes? Hey, Marcus.</p>
<p>I'm Jeff.</p>
<p>I'm, like, uh, Britta's boyfriend.</p>
<p>Look, dude, she started it.</p>
<p>She's just as into me.</p>
<p>No, listen, I'm not mad.</p>
<p>I was just fooling around and I sent those texts.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's disgusting, sending those pictures to your aunt.</p>
<p>More disgusting than what you texted to an underage boy? I didn't know you were you.</p>
<p>I didn't know you weren't my aunt.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let's just call this a draw.</p>
<p>Britta doesn't need to ever know about this.</p>
<p>Okay, I'd be happy to, for a price.</p>
<p>That was brave of you.</p>
<p>I owe you an apology.</p>
<p>It was rude to call you crazy.</p>
<p>Maybe I haven't been giving you enough credit.</p>
<p>Oh, that's really sweet.</p>
<p>Tell you what, why don't I go get Chang, and you can tell him that yourself.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>My God, that was amazing.</p>
<p>Good job, you saved the day.</p>
<p>That's amazing.</p>
<p>Way to go, man.</p>
<p>Way to go.</p>
<p>They beat the crap out of you.</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>It was okay.</p>
<p>I did a lot of ad-libbing Guys.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>Even I learned something.</p>
<p>Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>Group hug, group hug.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Way to save the day.</p>
<p>Nice work.</p>
<p>Oh, love you.</p>
<p>Did you get hit in the face? Before you say anything, I want you to know, even though I did nothing wrong, I'm still gonna give you money.</p>
<p>No, I can't take your money, Pierce.</p>
<p>I can't go from depending on my parents to depending on you, which is why I'm gonna get a job.</p>
<p>So you're cutting me off? No.</p>
<p>Pierce, I know you don't depend on anyone, but you do depend on people depending on you.</p>
<p>So I'm not gonna take your money.</p>
<p>We're still friends? Give me a day.</p>
<p>By the way, you're mom is the period fairy, right? Hey, guys, I found my phone, but has anyone seen my bra?</p>
<p>It's 2 a.m.</p>
