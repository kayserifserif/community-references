<p>I am the system.</p>
<p>I consume humanity.</p>
<p>There is no escape.</p>
<p>Objection!</p>
<p># Jeff Winger, hero at law #</p>
<p># Best lawyer you ever saw #</p>
<p># Hero to freedom, defender of liberty #</p>
<p># South of the forty on Lincoln #</p>
<p># You park for free! #</p>
<p>Jeff. Are you a good person being sued, oppressed, or beaten? I can help, and that's the Winger guarantee.</p>
<p>Call 555-her. Maybe you should've spent less money on special effect.</p>
<p>Huh, thanks a lot, Francis Ford repo man.</p>
<p>Ohh, Jeff Winger!</p>
<p># Loser at law #</p>
<p># Rented office in a mini mall #</p>
<p>Relax, tango.</p>
<p>I come in peace.</p>
<p>Way I see it, I screwed you.</p>
<p>I got screwed back.</p>
<p>Now we can bygone the bygones, because I got a juicy new client and a bone to throw you.</p>
<p>You hear about that bridge that collapsed upstate? A human could've said that without salivating.</p>
<p>I represent Marvin Humphries, the engineer who designed it.</p>
<p>He wants to seek damages.</p>
<p>From what? His own pencil? From the only school reckless enough to give him a degree in engineering.</p>
<p>City-funded school, deep government pockets.</p>
<p>Maybe you've heard of it.</p>
<p>Greendale Community College.</p>
<p>Weird choice, by the way, the bachelor's degree on the wall.</p>
<p>So you're gonna sue my old school and you're bothering to tell me? You have access there.</p>
<p>I need Marvin's records to prove that he was irresponsibly educated.</p>
<p>Well, why don't you just subpoena? Right, so they can have a shredding party.</p>
<p>See, that's the difference between you and Greendale, Alan.</p>
<p>They wouldn't shred evidence.</p>
<p>It's a good place for good people.</p>
<p>It's a diploma mill.</p>
<p>It turns idiots into bridge-collapsers and Jeff Winger into an attorney that thought he could help people? Jeff, I once saw you convince an arson victim that he liked his house better burned.</p>
<p>God, look what that school did to you.</p>
<p>It took all your money.</p>
<p>It took four years of your life.</p>
<p>And worst of all, it took your Winger moves.</p>
<p>I still got my Winger moves.</p>
<p>Prove it.</p>
<p>Get me Humphries' records.</p>
<p>Because the next bone you get thrown might be through a dude's zipper in the warehouse district, and I can't guarantee you it'll be from me.</p>
<p>Look, I might be broke, desperate, and nearly homeless, but I still got one thing deep down inside that gives me power That was it.</p>
<p>That was all I had.</p>
<p>Welcome back, human beings.</p>
<p>Dean Pelton here, wishing you another magic year at Greendale, ranked America's number two community college by GreendaleCommunityCollege.</p>
<p>Com.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent tragedy surrounding a certain collapsed bridge, we will be observing a moment of silence on the quad followed by four years of silence to the press.</p>
<p>I told you you'd be back.</p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard.</p>
<p>I'm not here.</p>
<p>I'm just a figment of your creeping dementia.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>How would I go about getting records for certain alumni? Why would you think a stranger could just walk in here and do that? - You're, uh, Rita.</p>
<p>Rhonda.</p>
<p>I've always regretted not telling you how much you remind me of my aunt.</p>
<p>It's more disarming than it sounds.</p>
<p>I have a very attractive aunt.</p>
<p>Rhonda, why are you wearing Jeff Winger's -</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Are you, uh, looking for your friends? They don't go here anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe you're looking for something that was in front of you the whole time just a pitch.</p>
<p>He's asking for records for a certain alumni.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this Marvin Humphries business, I doubt this is a coincidence.</p>
<p>You're here to save me, aren't you? - Yes.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I thought I might contact alumni to form a committee The Save Greendale Committee.</p>
<p>Working title.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I'm gonna cry.</p>
<p>Please don't.</p>
<p>Request denied.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Rhonda will let you in the records room.</p>
<p>It's actually your old study room.</p>
<p>After you and your friends left, it was closed for sentimental reasons.</p>
<p>And asbestos reasons, but it's clean as a whistle now.</p>
<p>"Harassment Reports," "Hazardous Waste Citations," "Herpes Comma Water Fountains." </p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Where's Humphries? I see your value now.</p>
<p>Abed, why? - "I see your value now." </p>
<p>It's a callback to when we met first season.</p>
<p>And me calling years "seasons" is a callback to my first season dialogue, and me calling Abed, I know what makes you off-putting, but why are you here? The Dean called me about the Save Greendale Committee.</p>
<p>Can I join? - Well, I - Oh, no.</p>
<p>Who else did he call? - Just me.</p>
<p>I called everyone else.</p>
<p>Jeffrey! Jeff!</p>
<p>Is that cool? - It's the coolest.</p>
<p>Jeff, if you wanted to save Greendale, why didn't you call us first? Well, you guys just got sprung from this joint, and I figured you had careers to get started.</p>
<p>Yeah, working hard.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.</p>
<p>What have they done to our home? The table's buried.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>This is where we became a family.</p>
<p>Jeff made us a family.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>We could repilot it.</p>
<p>This could be like Scrubs season nine, a revamp, a do-over.</p>
<p>Jeff could come back to Greendale as a teacher.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna be a teacher, Abed.</p>
<p>That's lame.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Sit in your chair.</p>
<p>Complete the table.</p>
<p>We want to help you save Greendale.</p>
<p>ALL: Yeah! Greendale! Greendale! Greendale! I got to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Mm, give him space.</p>
<p>Repiloting can be intense.</p>
<p>New people show up.</p>
<p>Regulars shift roles or even fall away.</p>
<p>Season nine of Scrubs, Zach Braff was<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Scrubs</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403'>Scrubs</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>2001&ndash;2010</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span></span></span></span>in the first six episodes.</p>
<p>That son of a bitch.</p>
<p>After everything scrubs did for him? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Vision boarding.</p>
<p>Okay, vision boarding! Oh, hi, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Dean, I have to warn you about something, because it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But first, why is there a big empty box on your desk that says "Humphries" on it? Okay, the press has been calling about Humphries, and I didn't want any details about his enrollment here to be spun against us, so now there are no details.</p>
<p>Oh, ooh.</p>
<p>That was his thesis.</p>
<p>Okay! So sue me! This ain't Harvard, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Okay, my job is to give a certain number of degrees per year, or we could get shut down.</p>
<p>And that would be bad because --</p>
<p>Ah, because then I wouldn't have a job.</p>
<p>And, you know, Greendale is a good place for good people.</p>
<p>That whole spiel, huh? Yeah.</p>
<p>That whole spiel.</p>
<p>Wingblade.</p>
<p>Shock me by impressing me.</p>
<p>He shredded Humphries.</p>
<p>What? I told you! How could you let this happen? Sir, I have to ask you to leave the concierge desk.</p>
<p>Jeff, this case was all I had.</p>
<p>I am screwed! My wife left.</p>
<p>My girlfriend dumped me.</p>
<p>And they're sisters, so now the whole family's pissed.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Bring me all the paperwork for filing a class action.</p>
<p>Letters of intent, engagement, everything.</p>
<p>Multiple copies.</p>
<p>Winger, you just lost our client! Yeah.</p>
<p>But I can create five new ones.</p>
<p>It's so dusty.</p>
<p>Let's get this off the table.</p>
<p>And that's the Winger guarantee.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe we should bring strong fundraising ideas - That aren't bake sales - Hey.</p>
<p>Or opening a zoo where the humans are in cages and the animals come to visit.</p>
<p>G'oh!</p>
<p>Are you okay, Jeff? You left kind of freaked out.</p>
<p>Well, I can't stop thinking this school might be in trouble because of this bridge-collapsing guy.</p>
<p>He's the one making bad bridges.</p>
<p>That's like me blaming owls for how much I suck at analogies.</p>
<p>Sometimes a student will claim, in court, that their school ruined their life, and they'll win.</p>
<p>You want to save Greendale? - Make it litigation-proof.</p>
<p>How? Think like the enemy.</p>
<p>How did Greendale damage you, Annie? It didn't.</p>
<p>I love hospital administration.</p>
<p>Is that your job? - Wellnot yet.</p>
<p>But I administer things to hospitals, like these.</p>
<p>Pen? "Futurza"? They're a rising star in pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>They invented fibromyalgia and the cure for fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>You push drugs now? That's ironic.</p>
<p>I push pens, Britta.</p>
<p>Speaking of irony, how's the therapy market? - Depressed? - I'm on sabbatical.</p>
<p>You're jewish? I'm doing hands-on research about the psychology of alcoholism.</p>
<p>You're a bartender, aren't you? Which is basically like a modern-day therapist.</p>
<p>If somebody tells me about a murder, I can't tell anyone.</p>
<p>Wow, you're even bad at bartending.</p>
<p>What about you? Abed's working on the next billion-dollar social media app.</p>
<p>And when it takes off, all I got to do is sue him.</p>
<p>It's fool-proof.</p>
<p>You're programming now, Abed? Didn't get any work with your four-year film degree? One job, directing a commercial.</p>
<p>Still haven't been paid.</p>
<p>I'll cut you a check tomorrow, but just so we're clear, you quit.</p>
<p>Creative differences.</p>
<p>I asked you to put the phone number on the screen.</p>
<p>I didn't like the number.</p>
<p>It's the number of my business.</p>
<p>It sounds fake.</p>
<p>How can every number start with 555? Are there only 10,000 numbers? Abed, you quit? You said you got fired.</p>
<p>You haven't paid the rent of our apartment in two months.</p>
<p>Well, why don't you sell him a pill that will help him give up on his dreams? Relaxabrex doesn't make you give up on your dreams.</p>
<p>That's a side effect.</p>
<p>At least the drugs I sell don't get slurped out of my belly button.</p>
<p>That's only on Tummy Tuesdays! - Oh, it's okay - Oh, I'm sorry Andre left again.</p>
<p>It's - it's not like last time.</p>
<p>He's staying with family.</p>
<p>He took the boys.</p>
<p>He took the dog.</p>
<p>He took the D.V.R.</p>
<p>It was my fault this time.</p>
<p>I cheated on him with Shirley's Sandwiches.</p>
<p>I threw the money into expanding.</p>
<p>I just didn't think I could fail.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, just so you know, this is the sort of stuff that someone could use to make a claim against a school.</p>
<p>I have to go to the bathroom again.</p>
<p>While I'm gone, I want you to think about what I said as an exercise.</p>
<p>Do you guys feel weird about doing this without Magnitude? That's everything you asked for.</p>
<p>Who are you flipping? My friends, who are now the Save Greendale Committee, which I created.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Classic Winger.</p>
<p>I forgot what it was like to be good at being bad.</p>
<p>So just close the deal and bring it home to daddy, eh? Oh, sorry, Alan.</p>
<p>Change of daddies.</p>
<p>I'll take it from here.</p>
<p>No, no, but it's my case.</p>
<p>Humphries was your case.</p>
<p>Jeff - You're scaring me.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Guys like you should be more scared.</p>
<p>You trust-funded, body-sprayed, Eli-Roth-DVD owner You're an amateur monster, Alan, and you stomp in the grave of a real monster who was willing to stay buried because real monsters have shame, because they wish that You're not worth the monologue.</p>
<p>Give me your tie.</p>
<p>What? No monologue for you.</p>
<p>Give me your tie.</p>
<p>That's for making me go to this school.</p>
<p>That's for making the last four years happen.</p>
<p>And now I get to make them un-happen for me and the only people I care about.</p>
<p>I failed my husband.</p>
<p>I failed my kids.</p>
<p>I've failed Bones.</p>
<p>I'm helping to hook a whole new batch of little Annies on Adderall.</p>
<p>I've been spending so much time with computers, your tears are just ones and zeroes to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you were a real Hallmark card before.</p>
<p>I'm much sadder than the rest of you.</p>
<p>I will figure out why later.</p>
<p>Jeff, full disclosure Our lives are worse than the day we got here.</p>
<p>Well, that is a serious allegation to arrive at all by yourselves.</p>
<p>Are you sure? - Yes.</p>
<p>And we've come to a decision as a group, and please don't judge us for suggesting it.</p>
<p>Hey, I'll back you up no matter what.</p>
<p>We decided to re-enroll at Greendale.</p>
<p>What? Are you nuts?</p>
<p>Greendale! Greendale! Greendale! Greendale! You guys want to keep it down?</p>
<p>Chang? - Kevin? Chang.</p>
<p>I've dropped the amnesia thing, copped to my crimes, and went to jail.</p>
<p>Now I'm on work release.</p>
<p>Working as what? - Math teacher.</p>
<p>Next, explain the pajamas.</p>
<p>Well, I'm on work release from house arrest, but I don't have a home.</p>
<p>See this? This won't let me travel and this only has a 30-yard cord, so I can only travel Whatever.</p>
<p>You do the math.</p>
<p>You said you teach math.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I teach it.</p>
<p>You do it.</p>
<p>Chang was faking his Changnesia? They seriously rehired a teacher they fired for trying to burn down the school? After being rehired as a security guard after being fired for impersonating a teacher.</p>
<p>That's insane, and I'm Abed.</p>
<p>Worse than insane.</p>
<p>Irresponsible.</p>
<p>Evil.</p>
<p>I don't believe in evil.</p>
<p>But this school clearly got a finger up its butt as a child.</p>
<p>This place ruins lives.</p>
<p>If that were true, then what could we possibly do about it?</p>
<p>Make 'em dance, Winger.</p>
<p>Ew, Jeff, what's your evil old legal nemesis doing here? Nemesis? No, we were partners again until I lost my usefulness.</p>
<p>I may be evil, but your friend here is so much more dangerous.</p>
<p>Tell 'em how it took you to make them think they wanted to sue their own school.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll leave you to pick up these pieces.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go score some blow.</p>
<p>My dealer's a gym teacher here.</p>
<p>You were lying to us? I never lied to you.</p>
<p>I showed you the right truth.</p>
<p>Britta, when we met, you were an eclectic anarchist.</p>
<p>How did you become the group's airhead? Thank you? And, Shirley, you've gone from an independent divorcee striking out on her own to a bankrupt fry cook hoping for a call from her husband.</p>
<p>Troy, your entire identity has been consumed by your relationship with another man.</p>
<p>You found my Clive Owen Tumblr.</p>
<p>And what happened to Annie the Unstoppable Go-getter? Well, there was that gas leak last year.</p>
<p>Oh, don't blame it all on the gas leak year.</p>
<p>This was a four-year process.</p>
<p>We went in one end as real people and out the other end as mixed-up cartoons.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>This coming from the guy who's had how many psychotic breaks on campus? Are we including the gas leak year? You all came here with a chance to be something, and you all had that taken away from you.</p>
<p>Get something back.</p>
<p>Seek damages.</p>
<p>Sign here.</p>
<p>But you're our hero.</p>
<p>I mean, in the commercial The commercial was a lie.</p>
<p>You staged a robot fight? Yeah.</p>
<p>In real life, the robot wins.</p>
<p>Troy? If Jeff didn't change, then Jeff is right.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Let's make some money.</p>
<p>Okay, Jeff, if this is what you really want to do.</p>
<p>I'll sign.</p>
<p>The choice to make is yours.</p>
<p>No, it's yours.</p>
<p>We're putting Greendale in your hands.</p>
<p>Do we all have to say something? - No, you can just sign it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You brought us together.</p>
<p>With lies.</p>
<p>But what you do is above lying, remember? You show us the right truth.</p>
<p>You won't regret this.</p>
<p>I'd like to take the study room table in back and burn it.</p>
<p>Burn it? Why? The same reason I never returned Time Bandits to Blockbuster.</p>
<p>Nobody else deserves it.</p>
<p>Jesus! Looks as if you've lost your way.</p>
<p>Pierce? Continue on this path, and you might miss your last chance to see the Pierce Hawthorne Museum of Gender Sensitivity and Sexual Potency on the central quad.</p>
<p>The museum and this hologram were donated in compliance with a court order I'm not allowed to discuss.</p>
<p>Let's just say some women can't take a compliment.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>What I am allowed to discuss is Greendale, and I'll say this Don't turn your back on it.</p>
<p>Take it from a man with no legal right to be there.</p>
<p>You're in a special place.</p>
<p>A crappy place, sure, but only because it gives crappy people a chance to sort themselves out.</p>
<p>Did I sound gay at the end? Do you want to do another take? Ahh! Jeffrey, I'm not decent.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>These are the signatures of the five people that are crazy enough to care about this toilet.</p>
<p>And tonight, I almost got them to sue it.</p>
<p>Heed the warning! - It's not easy being Dean, Jeffrey! Then stop being the Dean! It's my whole ideantity! I mean, wah, see what I did there? That's proof! Get your crap together.</p>
<p>Your job is not to hand out degrees.</p>
<p>Your job is to make this a toilet that people don't have to be crazy to care about.</p>
<p>But you could stay here and help me save the school.</p>
<p>For how much money? I-I can't offer you any money.</p>
<p>I could offer you a job.</p>
<p>You just described slavery.</p>
<p>I mean, there's nothing in the budget for school saver, but I could hire you as -</p>
<p>Screw you, Abed.</p>
<p>I'd be depressed right now if these samples from work weren't giving me a new outlook on life.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more, ask your doctor if Joyvatrex is right for you.</p>
<p>Oh, honey.</p>
<p>If we sue Greendale, can I be a surprise witness? Wait.</p>
<p>Don't tell me.</p>
<p>Stop! We shouldn't sue the school.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Come on! Are you trying to give us emotional whiplash? Look, if you feel there's more work to be done on yourselves, then as crappy as this place is, it's a place that you can do it.</p>
<p>You got a job teaching here, didn't you? I don't want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Well, then, I'm getting back into forensic science.</p>
<p>That was my actual dream.</p>
<p>It's my fault I bailed on it.</p>
<p>A film degree doesn't make me a filmmaker.</p>
<p>I need to learn how to work with other people.</p>
<p>I need to figure out who I am.</p>
<p>I'll help you.</p>
<p>Get out of my brain.</p>
<p>I need to learn how to really run a business by my own standards, not Greendale's.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a four-year psych degree, then a master's, and become a real psychologist.</p>
<p>Or you could find another major.</p>
<p>A real psychologist.</p>
<p>How about English? - Psychology.</p>
<p>All right, what's important is, no matter what, we'll be trying to talk Britta into doing something different together.</p>
<p>Burn, hopelessness.</p>
<p>We got this.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, be careful!</p>
<p>Little victories count for a lot around here Wow, this is good.</p>
<p>Even if you never asked to win in the first place.</p>
<p>And you have to enjoy those nice moments while you can.</p>
<p>See, he does a voice-over wrap-up at the end of every episode.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Because around here, they never last very long.</p>
<p>__ Once more.</p>
<p>More teachery.</p>
<p>I want to kill myself.</p>
<p>Use that.</p>
<p>Are you a good person? Yes, unlike you.</p>
<p>I canguarantee.</p>
<p>The Winger-beaten you.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p></p>
