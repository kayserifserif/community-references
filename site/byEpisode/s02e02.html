<p>Why is everyone wearing those hats? Is the dean planning another event, or is the Greendale Hat Club struggling to be noteworthy? You're talking about it.</p>
<p>I talk about stuff that annoys me.</p>
<p>Speaking of the dean Guten Tag, homies.</p>
<p>I hope you'll all be attending Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>Don't often get to celebrate German culture.</p>
<p>It's not often we want to.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little goes a long way.</p>
<p>True, Greendale's Oktoberfest has never drawn huge crowds, probably due to our diversity, so this year, we are adding some color.</p>
<p>Kick it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna give this to you, Troy.</p>
<p>"Pop and Locktoberfest." </p>
<p>The central event will be a pop-and-Iock-a-thon.</p>
<p>Winner gets to annex Poland.</p>
<p>Kidding.</p>
<p>The winner gets an iTunes gift card.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, a break dance contest.</p>
<p>What should we name our team? Gonna go hang myself in my closet.</p>
<p>I'm coming with.</p>
<p>Is it me, or is this campus getting more cartoonish every day? It's exciting.</p>
<p>I painted a tunnel on the library.</p>
<p>When it dries, I'm going for it.</p>
<p>See that guy over there? The one wearing the Gucci suit in a lightweight woven wool-mohair? We used to work together.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So he's from your origins? This is all I need.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>You're all my friend needs.</p>
<p>Your mouth isn't curved upwards.</p>
<p>Did I misread something? Aw, Tango? Sundance.</p>
<p>We worked with different partners.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What brings you to Greendale? I'm a teacher.</p>
<p>Wait, that's worse than the truth.</p>
<p>I'm a student.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm in no position to judge.</p>
<p>I'm here for an NA meeting.</p>
<p>Narcotics Anonymous? Remember when you asked for my secret, I said yoga? I lied.</p>
<p>I'm Abed.</p>
<p>Abed, this is Alan Connor.</p>
<p>This guy and I used to wipe the courtroom floor with prosecutors.</p>
<p>DA called us The Litterbugs, we put so much trash back out on the street.</p>
<p>Come here, come here.</p>
<p>You still ticklish? Stop that.</p>
<p>Hey, let's get a drink, huh? Are you allowed? Yeah, I quit doing blow, not being rad.</p>
<p>All right, let's do it.</p>
<p>Jeff can't go.</p>
<p>He has class.</p>
<p>Well, those cargo pants would suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>What has this place done to you? You have no idea.</p>
<p>Hat Club.</p>
<p>Now you have some idea.</p>
<p>So? So? Anyone that's been in a team pop-and-Iock-a-thon knows you need seven people to stand a chance.</p>
<p>We have seven.</p>
<p>Oh, do you? Word on campus is Winger's too busy hanging with his cool lawyer friend.</p>
<p>Slow news day.</p>
<p>That's your Carson? Jon Stewart.</p>
<p>You depress me.</p>
<p>Look, we'll get back to you.</p>
<p>All right, well, don't take too long.</p>
<p>And don't rip off this exit.</p>
<p>Where is Jeff? Obviously hanging with Alan.</p>
<p>Those two are like Siamese twins attached at the cell phone holster.</p>
<p>I haven't met him yet.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we be happy that Jeff found an old friend? Alan is to Jeff what <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Rob Lowe</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507'>Rob Lowe</a></span><span class='years'>1964&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086066'>tt0086066</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105793'>tt0105793</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884'>tt0118884</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090060'>tt0090060</a></span></span></span></span> is to <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>James Spader</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000652'>James Spader</a></span><span class='years'>1960&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>actor</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402711'>tt0402711</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2741602'>tt2741602</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427'>tt2395427</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098724'>tt0098724</a></span></span></span></span> in 1990's Bad <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Bad Influence</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099091'>Bad Influence</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1990&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Thriller</span></span></span></span>'s a bad influence.</p>
<p>You saw it? Hey, guys, I'm gonna be a little bit late today.</p>
<p>Alan and I are gonna take a quick sidebar.</p>
<p>Or any bar.</p>
<p>Oh, he's got Britta down.</p>
<p>You look familiar.</p>
<p>It's possible.</p>
<p>Have you or someone you know been injured at work? Oh.</p>
<p>Yes, a shrimp boat ran over my cousin.</p>
<p>That's serious.</p>
<p>Call me.</p>
<p>Jeff, you need to be respectful of our time.</p>
<p>Shirley, if I killed a man, as a Christian, would you forgive me? I would.</p>
<p>Then either that man's life is worth less than your time, or it's okay for me to be late.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>You've still got the moves, man.</p>
<p>If they gave away awards for mind games, the statue would be Jeff Winger doing it to a brain.</p>
<p>Come on, Jeff's bush-league.</p>
<p>I gave seminars on manipulation.</p>
<p>I can reach into a man's soul and unravel it with one tug.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Hit me.</p>
<p>You're bald.</p>
<p>So are you.</p>
<p>I'll kill you, you! Come here.</p>
<p>Mistrial.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>I have hair.</p>
<p>Father, I have hair.</p>
<p>On a tax evasion case? Yeah.</p>
<p>God, I miss talking about this stuff.</p>
<p>You should visit the office.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I can't show my face there after getting busted like that.</p>
<p>Jeff, you know what lawyers call someone who defrauds the state bar, cheats on his LSATs and cons his way into a firm? Best lawyer ever.</p>
<p>Seriously? Hey, tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Office party.</p>
<p>You're my guest.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Come on, you just said you missed it.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I really, really do.</p>
<p>What does Alan have that we don't? A butt for Jeff's wiener.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>I mean, we all have butts too.</p>
<p>We have butts, just not for the same thing.</p>
<p>I'm trying to say they're gay.</p>
<p>I don't like how much drinking and carousing they do.</p>
<p>It's a gateway to narcotics.</p>
<p>Narcotics! I know how I know Alan.</p>
<p>But I'm not allowed to say.</p>
<p>Which means that you met him in Narcotics Anonymous.</p>
<p>Why bring it up if you're not allowed? Because He said something at a meeting about something bad he did.</p>
<p>He might have done it to Jeff, but I can't say what it is.</p>
<p>Okay, you've gone from precious to annoying.</p>
<p>What if you don't say it, but we guess? Like charades? With this group, I'm watching.</p>
<p>Four words.</p>
<p>"Alan got Jeff disbarred." </p>
<p>Uh, those junkies weren't thinking about rules when they were shooting up scag.</p>
<p>Jeff, Alan narced on you.</p>
<p>"Narced"? Hm.</p>
<p>But he's, like, way too primo for that, Frank Zappa.</p>
<p>I think he turned you in to the state bar.</p>
<p>I was in NA and he bragged about it.</p>
<p>He doesn't recognize me because my hair's longer, my skin's clearer, I've lost a lot of weight --</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>He said he turned me in?</p>
<p>He said he sent an e-mail that got a rival co-worker fired around the time you got caught.</p>
<p>They never covered this on Yo Gabba Gabba, but that's circumstantial.</p>
<p>Any other meaningless conspiracy theories? Yes.</p>
<p>Did you know that Go-Gurt is just yogurt? Know what a therapist calls this kind of relationship? A gold mine.</p>
<p>Codependent.</p>
<p>You guys don't want me to be happy.</p>
<p>You want me to need you.</p>
<p>It's getting claustrophobic.</p>
<p>I used to run full-speed through the boundless wilderness and now I'm in the zoo where the horizon is wallpaper and the air is stale and nothing is ever at stake.</p>
<p>In other words, we're not cool.</p>
<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>You may have heard it.</p>
<p>I may have thought it.</p>
<p>It may be true.</p>
<p>But I never said it.</p>
<p>See you at the pop-and-Iock-a-thon? No, Abed, I'm going to a cool party at my cool former law firm from when my life was cool.</p>
<p>Fine, you can be on the team.</p>
<p>New deal.</p>
<p>If we win, I get to be in the study group.</p>
<p>The stakes have never been higher.</p>
<p>Just want to thank everybody for coming.</p>
<p>You know, when I became a lawyer, I had a dream.</p>
<p>I had a dream that one day I'd be head of a firm so nobody would be able to talk about the big, weird hole in my hand.</p>
<p>Everybody talks about it behind my back.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>You know, I would.</p>
<p>What's great, though, is that you don't stare or ask any questions.</p>
<p>And as a reward for your restraint, I got a little something for you.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>That ought to keep you going till Christmas.</p>
<p>Everybody have fun tonight.</p>
<p>Anyone else with that hand would wear a glove.</p>
<p>He controls a room with it.</p>
<p>He's the master.</p>
<p>Well, he sure is a fan of yours.</p>
<p>Oh, um, hey, when you talk to him, will you mention me? He keeps passing me over for partner.</p>
<p>Alan, did you invite me here with an ulterior motive? God, I miss this place.</p>
<p>God, it's a sea of Wingers.</p>
<p>This whole place reeks of moral ambiguity.</p>
<p>Actually, that was me.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>Now, you guys are new to high society, so just follow my lead and you'll be fine.</p>
<p>First, why are you here? Second, I don't care.</p>
<p>Leave.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Jeff, we were invited.</p>
<p>Why would anyone do that? Hey, you guys made it.</p>
<p>Come on in.</p>
<p>Before this gets more embarrassing, what is your misguided plan? To apologize to you for casting aspersions on your friend.</p>
<p>And to show you we can be cool.</p>
<p>Hey, is that Jeff Winger? Find Annie and leave.</p>
<p>Ted.</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>What's going on? Wow, hey.</p>
<p>Once Annie gets Alan's office number, you break into his office.</p>
<p>Hack into his e-mails and find proof that he screwed Jeff over.</p>
<p>Fourth floor, 470.</p>
<p>First he said it was 69.</p>
<p>I wanna rub Purell on my brain.</p>
<p>You are so missed here.</p>
<p>If we had five guys with your balls, we wouldn't need 30 lawyers.</p>
<p>True, but we'd need a good doctor.</p>
<p>Ted, stop hitting on my date.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>I'm kidding.</p>
<p>We can share.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>I get the head.</p>
<p>I love the brain in there.</p>
<p>Ow, ow, ow.</p>
<p>I'll eat it.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, Jeff Winger's here.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Should we notify someone that our team is not gonna make it to the pop-and-Iock-a-thon? You actually think anybody cares? Checking in for the Heather Pop-and-Locklears? Okay.</p>
<p>And where's the rest of your team? They'll be here.</p>
<p>You're allowed to start by yourself.</p>
<p>But you won't stand a chance without someone They'll be here.</p>
<p>I brought stuff people use for capers.</p>
<p>Suction cup.</p>
<p>Credit card.</p>
<p>Chloroform.</p>
<p>The credit card doesn't work, the chloroform does.</p>
<p>Annie, go back and keep lookout.</p>
<p>Why me, lookout? Why not you guys? If someone comes up, Kanye and Kumar get taken to jail.</p>
<p>You get taken to dinner.</p>
<p>You guys, I'm the smartest one in this whole group and all I've been used for is bait and distraction.</p>
<p>Ugh! Go on your stupid mission.</p>
<p>I hope it sucks.</p>
<p>What did she say? I don't know.</p>
<p>All I heard was "suck." </p>
<p>I'm surprised Alan hasn't made partner.</p>
<p>I'm surprised I haven't fired him.</p>
<p>Why? He's got a better win record than I do.</p>
<p>He's a spineless trust fund jag off.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, Jeff.</p>
<p>You're the best liar I ever employed.</p>
<p>If you can look me in the eye and tell me you actually like Alan, I'll make him a full partner.</p>
<p>Well, I only ever really liked one person.</p>
<p>My mom.</p>
<p>And she liked my dad.</p>
<p>And after all the dust and the custody was settled, the guy I really admired -- not liked, admired -- was the lawyer leaving the courthouse in the great-looking suit and a sky-blue Mercedes SLK.</p>
<p>Sweet ride.</p>
<p>Sweet job.</p>
<p>Sweet life.</p>
<p>He didn't care.</p>
<p>He couldn't care.</p>
<p>And the less he cared, the better he was.</p>
<p>We are a special breed because we rise above the sloppy stuff and look at the bottom line.</p>
<p>You wanna like your employees? Open a hair salon.</p>
<p>You wanna win? Make Alan partner.</p>
<p>The student has become the master.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jeff.</p>
<p>You make me wanna be a worse man.</p>
<p>Just because you can't work cases doesn't mean you can't work.</p>
<p>Be a consultant.</p>
<p>Ted, that would be amazing.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff, I'm sure you know Philip.</p>
<p>Did you know that if I sleep with Philip once a month, I can use his beach house in Rio whenever I want? Wow, you guys are really onto something.</p>
<p>I think you've found the world's newest profession.</p>
<p>Guys, guys.</p>
<p>I actually have a civil case against that bitch that stole my husband.</p>
<p>Don't sue a stripper.</p>
<p>Why not? She's a stripper.</p>
<p>Life sued her and she lost.</p>
<p>Where's Pierce? Jeez, why am I even worried about him? Hey.</p>
<p>Did you know there's an island in Indonesia where you can hunt people? We need to talk.</p>
<p>I think this is it.</p>
<p>Print it.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Who are you guys? This is not your office.</p>
<p>I can explain.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I usually have one foot out of reality.</p>
<p>Even I'm freaking out right now.</p>
<p>You chloroformed the janitor? Stop yelling! You got caught! You're the one yelling.</p>
<p>We're in trouble.</p>
<p>We have to do something.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>My whole brain is crying.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>Okay, it may sound a little weird, but trust me.</p>
<p>What's happening? Oh.</p>
<p>We all got chloroformed.</p>
<p>Somebody chloroformed all of us.</p>
<p>And now we're regaining consciousness together.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Who is she? Why is she holding a rag? That was the worst idea ever.</p>
<p>Can we run away now? Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It is the fourth straight hour and Ben Chang is still on his own.</p>
<p>One can only imagine what is driving him to push himself to such limits.</p>
<p>My body hurts.</p>
<p>My body hurts.</p>
<p>Are you jealous because we were fitting in with your cool friends? No, I'm distracted watching you mutate.</p>
<p>Britta, you're not a whore.</p>
<p>Shirley, Jesus turned the other cheek.</p>
<p>He didn't garnish wages.</p>
<p>Pierce, do I even need to say this? It is bad to hunt man for sport.</p>
<p>Badass.</p>
<p>This is the e-mail that Alan sent the bar association.</p>
<p>He stabbed you in the back, Jeff.</p>
<p>He's a bad friend.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>He's a bad friend.</p>
<p>But he's a good lawyer.</p>
<p>I appreciate you guys caring, but you have to understand that I don't.</p>
<p>Caring is lethal around here.</p>
<p>It's a disease.</p>
<p>You guys have it.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>So if you do care about me, don't infect me.</p>
<p>Now go win that pop-and-Iock-a-thon.</p>
<p>I'll see you Monday.</p>
<p>It's like watching a soul slip through our fingers.</p>
<p>But what more can we do? Would you stop? Tango.</p>
<p>I don't know how you did it, man, but you're looking at the firm's next partner.</p>
<p>If I wasn't actively repressing my bi-curiosity, I'd kiss you on your beautiful mouth.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can return the favor one day.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe I can return it right now.</p>
<p>You probably know it was someone here at the firm who turned you in.</p>
<p>God, this is really hard.</p>
<p>Alan, it's okay.</p>
<p>You can tell me.</p>
<p>It was Thompson.</p>
<p>Thompson.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thompson, that adopted three at-risk teens and donated his kidney to a temp.</p>
<p>All an act.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why do you think he quit right after you left? Well, his wife died.</p>
<p>Did she, Jeff? Did she? Anyway, congrats.</p>
<p>Hey, let's go do some shots with Phil, huh? No, you go ahead.</p>
<p>I, uh, I think I caught something at Greendale.</p>
<p>College chicks.</p>
<p>I get you.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>You're bad.</p>
<p>Come on, it hurts.</p>
<p>Come on, it hurts.</p>
<p>Come on, it hurts.</p>
<p>Ben, you need to switch up your moves.</p>
<p>Whoa, do my eyes deceive me? Troy Barnes tagging in for the save.</p>
<p>Only two teams left.</p>
<p>The Poppy Lockstockings and the Heather Pop-and-Locklears.</p>
<p>Troy, what's wrong? I don't know.</p>
<p>My heart's just not in it.</p>
<p>Maybe we should quit.</p>
<p>I mean, who even cares about this anyway? Next up, looks like Jeffrey Winger.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeffrey, you're back.</p>
<p>Did you miss me? Took you long enough.</p>
<p>Oh! Now we got it.</p>
<p>Hey, hey!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Moves McGee.</p>
<p>Whoo! Did you punch Alan in his rotten face and storm out? Hell, no.</p>
<p>That guy is useful to me.</p>
<p>Thanks to you, I've got leverage over a spineless jag that just made partner.</p>
<p>That is the place I want to work.</p>
<p>But I prefer to hang out with cool people.</p>
<p>People so cool, they care.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>And now, the puppet.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Ah, no parking on the dance floor, Winger.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>No, I'm serious.</p>
<p>You're disqualified.</p>
<p>The winners are Poppy Lockstockings.</p>
<p>No! I've been popping and locking for five hours and you threw it all away.</p>
<p>The contest doesn't matter.</p>
<p>What's important is we have each other.</p>
<p>Then can I be in your study group? Well, that wasn't the deal.</p>
<p>We lost, so That was dope what we did.</p>
<p>That was so good.</p>
<p>The puppet too.</p>
<p>The puppet was surprising.</p>
<p>I rolled my ankle during that, you know that? You know what? He's bringing us down.</p>
<p>Let's move him.</p>
<p>Can we move him? Psst! Troy, it's me.</p>
<p>Abed? I made it through.</p>
<p>I'm a cartoon now.</p>
<p>That's impossible.</p>
<p>Nothing's impossible in here.</p>
<p>Animals talk, your heart is shaped like a heart and the smell of pie can make you float.</p>
<p>You have to believe, Troy.</p>
<p>Wait, you don't have to believe.</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>I may have done some damage there.</p>
<p></p>
