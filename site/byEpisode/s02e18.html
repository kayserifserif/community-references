<div id='transcript'>
<p>Annie, two gifts? Thank you.</p>
<p>I wanted to get a doll, and since the father might be Andre or Chang, I wanted all ethnic bases covered.</p>
<p>So there's a little African-American girl and a letter from the manufacturer promising to expand their selection.</p>
<p>Oh, is everyone enjoying their egg rolls andlor mieliepap, a traditional maize porridge popular in Ghana? Annie, baby showers can be race neutral.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you for trying to be inclusive, but regardless of any biological happenstance, this baby'll be raised by Andre and I.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I seem to recall a story about a man named Joseph who raised a baby that wasn't his.</p>
<p>History's greatest chump.</p>
<p>We're talking about Joe Kennedy, right? It's cool.</p>
<p>If it's mine, I'll be a lovable uncle.</p>
<p>Okay, a creepy uncle, final offer.</p>
<p>From me and Troy.</p>
<p>When your child's a scavenger of the nuclear wasteland, water will be worth gold.</p>
<p>We wanted to get a sawed-off shotgun, but those were pretty expensive already.</p>
<p>You people eat this? I've never seen that in my life.</p>
<p>You really shouldn't say "you people." </p>
<p>Pierce was having trouble quitting offensive phrases.</p>
<p>We've created a bargaining system.</p>
<p>We traded "you people" for his other favorite phrases.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really got Jewish-personed out of that one.</p>
<p>Here, open mine.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>A cigar cutter, Maxim and hot sauce.</p>
<p>It's a theme gift.</p>
<p>Yeah, the theme is "stuff lying around my apartment." </p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>Can I get a ni hao up in this hizzy? Why is everyone in this school obsessed with race?</p>
<p>White people problems.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>That looks fun.</p>
<p>Oh, Troy, Abed.</p>
<p>Who's that cute guy that I saw you outside with earlier? Lukka, our friend.</p>
<p>He's in Troy's class.</p>
<p>He's awesome.</p>
<p>He has an accent, rolls his cigarettes and plays the same video games as us.</p>
<p>We like him a lot.</p>
<p>So you're not allowed to bone him.</p>
<p>You just guaranteed she'll bone him.</p>
<p>Who am I kidding? I should be putting this right on my thighs.</p>
<p>Abed, there's a guy on your 6.</p>
<p>I'm taking out my 9 mm.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>In my country, we give 9 mm to little girl for sweet 16.</p>
<p>Try grenade launcher.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>Hey, I was just stopping by.</p>
<p>Oh, is this a bad time?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that's no way to treat a girl that looks this way.</p>
<p>Come in.</p>
<p>I'm Lukka.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Like Britney Spears?</p>
<p>Exactly like Britney Spears.</p>
<p># Hit me with your genie's bottle #</p>
<p># Rub it all over me #</p>
<p>Britta was just leaving.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Stay.</p>
<p>Visit with your friends.</p>
<p>I must go anyway.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>I'm cooking podvarak.</p>
<p>I never had that.</p>
<p>I could make for you.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll give you my number.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You are her boyfriends?</p>
<p>No! I love these guys.</p>
<p>They make funny with their mouths.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>I leave.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What? He asked me out.</p>
<p>Not allowed.</p>
<p>Not allowed? You'll ruin him.</p>
<p>Ruin him? Stop repeating.</p>
<p>Stop re Remanding me.</p>
<p>Explain why I'll ruin him.</p>
<p>You date guys that we think are cool, and when you don't like them, you tell us horrible things about them.</p>
<p>Name one guy.</p>
<p>Carl, Todd, Kyle, Richard.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Fred.</p>
<p>Tall Kyle.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff? I ruined Jeff? Jeff "Nipple Play" Winger? No, we're still hanging out with him.</p>
<p>How's it going, Jeff? Promise you won't date Lukka, I'll give you a sweatshirt I made for paintball.</p>
<p>Pssh! You should've given me one a long time ago.</p>
<p>I kicked your asses.</p>
<p>Don't date Lukka.</p>
<p>Hit my genie bottle? What the? What was that? Oh, oh.</p>
<p>Jeff? I'm hoping you can help me with something.</p>
<p>Sure, let's have a look here.</p>
<p>Pieces of paper stapled together, a lot of writing.</p>
<p>This is as far as I can go.</p>
<p>I don't want you to read it.</p>
<p>Help me get Chang to sign it.</p>
<p>It's a little something I had an attorney draw up.</p>
<p>This is a forfeiture of parental rights.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Why do you need me to make Chang sign away his baby? Isn't he living with you? Not cool.</p>
<p>You have a rapport with him.</p>
<p>Not cool.</p>
<p>Besides, as your friend, can I tell you? Don't poke that bear.</p>
<p>I think, right now, you're as protected as you can get.</p>
<p>I don't see Chang as being a real hands-on baby-daddy.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Now we're in the business of knowing what's going on in Chang's head, huh? Huh? Fine, for the child.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>
<p>Not lately.</p>
<p>I'm, um, I'm so sorry, but could you just not tell Troy and Abed that we went out tonight? No problem.</p>
<p>It's just Um, they're just really worried if you and I, you know, see each other, it's gonna affect your friendship with them.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>I can keep a secret.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>I'm from the Balkans.</p>
<p>There are many things I try not to talk about.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Lukka, I knew it.</p>
<p>I knew there was pain in there.</p>
<p>Just so you know, you can talk to me about anything.</p>
<p>So much killing.</p>
<p>The corpses stacked like firewood.</p>
<p>The rivers red with their blood.</p>
<p>I miss it so much.</p>
<p>Lukka.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Wait, just, um, just to clarify.</p>
<p>When you say you miss it, it's like you have survivor's guilt.</p>
<p>You wish you were back over there, defending the motherland? Yes, I miss cleansing our fields and forests of the unclean people who stole my country.</p>
<p>I miss the smell of the villages burning.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>I miss the way they used to run from our tanks in fear.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>My neighbor is jazz musician.</p>
<p>Hey, Spencer.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>I have woman in here.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>He really knows how to kill the mood.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Did you look for a job? I was going to, but I noticed your coffee table was wobbly, so I decided to fix it.</p>
<p>Agh! Must be the floor.</p>
<p>Don't saw the floor.</p>
<p>Don't saw anything.</p>
<p>I'm tired of confiscating saws.</p>
<p>Give me that.</p>
<p>Take this.</p>
<p>Parental rights? You're adopting me? It's from Shirley.</p>
<p>It gives her and Andre the baby.</p>
<p>Sign it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone asks, this was my most convincing speech ever.</p>
<p>Why are you crying? Ugh.</p>
<p>Don't tell me you wanted to be a father.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, what if this is my last chance? Between you and me, I don't Chang a lot of chicks.</p>
<p>But fathers are responsible.</p>
<p>They have jobs.</p>
<p>You crash on people's couches and twitch in your sleep like a dog dreaming of a rabbit.</p>
<p>It's real.</p>
<p>You don't Wait.</p>
<p>So you're saying if I get a job and my own apartment, Shirley might let me be part of my baby's life? Yes.</p>
<p>That's exactly what I'm saying.</p>
<p>So does that mean I can? Go for it.</p>
<p>Where do you keep getting these? Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Where are you going? Grabbing lunch for a video-game session with Lukka.</p>
<p>Fork foods.</p>
<p>Don't wanna grease up the troops.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lukka, how much do you know about him? Why? You start dating him? You wanna tell us horrible things?</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Lukka's gonna teach us how to break the will of an entire village.</p>
<p>That sounds horrific.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Girls are so undesensitized.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>So how'd the talk go with Chang? About that.</p>
<p>I gave my most convincing speech ever and it didn't take.</p>
<p>Didn't take? We're not giving him a perm, we just need him to sign.</p>
<p>"Need" is a strong word.</p>
<p>I think Shirley would feel comfortable if we had something in writing.</p>
<p>However, I believe that we can handle whatever obstacle comes our way.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Baby.</p>
<p>Well, good morning, everybody.</p>
<p>Did you see the stock market today? Up, down, pick a direction.</p>
<p>Huh? I don't know about you, but I've been circling these want ads all morning.</p>
<p>Now, who wants to take a break and build a birdhouse? Chang, what's going on? Just getting my act together.</p>
<p>I got a baby coming.</p>
<p>I can almost hear the pitter-patter of Chinese feet across the treetops.</p>
<p>And when that happens, I gotta be the best dad I can be.</p>
<p>Right, Jeff? Huh? Come on, don't leave me hanging, my main mentor.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, is that a reason to leave? Hm? Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Why do I have to put the VCR on three if Bones is on five? Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>I know you're not gonna make a pregnant woman run.</p>
<p>I know you're not gonna make a pregnant woman walk this distance between us.</p>
<p>So I ask you to help me, and you take that as an opportunity to get Chang out? Hey, who am I to stand in the way of someone? Am I daytime television? Very cute.</p>
<p>How cute's it gonna be when that lunatic is dangling my baby over a lion cage on alternate weekends? Pretty cute.</p>
<p>Are they baby lions? New low, Jeff.</p>
<p>Even for you.</p>
<p>Shirley --</p>
<p>Mm! Right.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna make a pregnant woman storm off.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Look at them run.</p>
<p>They must die like the maggots that they are.</p>
<p>I didn't know we got points for killing villagers.</p>
<p>He's amazing.</p>
<p>And I thought I knew everything about this game.</p>
<p>Britta.</p>
<p>Hi, Lukka.</p>
<p>No! Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Guys, calm down.</p>
<p>I'm just here for my "Trekkies do it in the final frontier" hat.</p>
<p>That's my hat.</p>
<p>Really? Are you sure? Yep.</p>
<p>Hey, Lukka, you are really good at this game, and there must be a reason that you are so good at this game.</p>
<p>Though your flirtation technique is hilarious, it's distracting.</p>
<p>Lukka is kicking serious ass right now.</p>
<p>He just set fire to a farmers' market.</p>
<p>Bang, bang, you're dead! Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Save your tears for your dog mother in hell.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>You have DVD Blu-ray disc, Kickpuncher 3: The Final Kickening? You let me borrow, no? Sorry.</p>
<p>Thanks to Pierce, who kept writing "this side up" on my discs, I have a strict no-lending policy on my DVDs.</p>
<p>What would happen if somebody broke that rule? They'd be dead to me forever.</p>
<p>Maybe we watch Kickpuncher 3: The Final Kickening together.</p>
<p>Yes, Lukka, maybe we do.</p>
<p>Maybe we do.</p>
<p>Would you please leave? I don't want wanna play anymore.</p>
<p>I feel sick.</p>
<p>She's strange.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you for a second? Can't talk till I see my face in this.</p>
<p>Well, can I give you some advice, dad-to-dad? Hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>Where's my pipe? Okay.</p>
<p>What's on your mind, neighbor? Look, it's great you're trying to get your life together, but for your sake and for Shirley's, you need to relax a little.</p>
<p>Oh, I see what's going on.</p>
<p>Yeah? You're scared.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Feel me coming up on your tail, huh? No, no.</p>
<p>Man, listen.</p>
<p>I've been a father for 11 years and a good one for nine of those.</p>
<p>I'm there when they're sick, pick them up from school.</p>
<p>Help them with their homework.</p>
<p>It's not how you act, it's what you do.</p>
<p>Well, I do.</p>
<p>You think that pool table put aluminum siding on itself? Yeah, see, that's not what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>That's too bad.</p>
<p>What did that? I'll go ahead and consider that point missed.</p>
<p>I got your text.</p>
<p>What's going on? Something happened.</p>
<p>My Kickpuncher 3: The Final Kickening DVD is missing.</p>
<p>That's awful.</p>
<p>Somebody took it? Who would? Wait, Kickmuncher 3? Wasn't that the movie that Lukka was? You don't think? Unless You don't suppose -- However -- No.</p>
<p>That would mean that you guys would have to stop hanging out --</p>
<p>No! We have video of you taking the DVD.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Watch, I got this guy --</p>
<p>Lookit.</p>
<p>Lookit.</p>
<p>One more, brother, you get --</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have a security camera? It's for a documentary I'm making.</p>
<p>It's footage of me watching dailies, but it comes in handy.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you would pin it on Lukka.</p>
<p>Now you're just ruining cool guys for fun.</p>
<p>It's just cruelty, Britta, you're inhuman.</p>
<p>You're an inhuman person.</p>
<p>A monster.</p>
<p>Lukka's a monster for realsies.</p>
<p>I did this so you'd stop hanging out.</p>
<p>He's a war criminal.</p>
<p>You're embarrassing yourself.</p>
<p>In what war is he a criminal? The battle for our affections? Uh, how about the genocide in the Balkans? Mm, yeah.</p>
<p>You would say that.</p>
<p>You just got caught red-handed borrowing a DVD without permission.</p>
<p>You guys have to believe me.</p>
<p>He's so much worse than Tall Kyle.</p>
<p>Hey, jefe.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Who are these tiny people? I picked up Shirley's kids, and I'm helping out with their homework.</p>
<p>Hey, kids.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, watch the cardigan.</p>
<p>What? Why? To prove I'm a responsible dad.</p>
<p>This proves you're a kidnapper.</p>
<p>I am nuts! Get with the program! What have I done? I can't believe I said you could be a father.</p>
<p>I can be.</p>
<p>You can't be anything, you never will.</p>
<p>I pretended to have faith in you to get you out of my apartment.</p>
<p>Now, call Shirley and beg forgiveness.</p>
<p>Kids, why don't you get your stuff together? I'll take you home.</p>
<p>Who's Shirley? Shirley's your mom, dumb-ass.</p>
<p>Our mom's name is Loquanda.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>That's racist.</p>
<p>Wait, is your mom's name really Loquanda? Yeah.</p>
<p>You said you're a friend of hers.</p>
<p>Why didn't you know that, dumb-ass? I do.</p>
<p>I was just playing an educational game with you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Don't give me that lip.</p>
<p>Kids, you mind waiting in the hallway? Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I want you to understand something.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You are a horrible human being.</p>
<p>I will never feel sorry for you again.</p>
<p>I don't care what happens to you, and when I get back, I want you gone.</p>
<p>Believe me.</p>
<p>I will definitely be far, far away from here.</p>
<p>Hi, policemen.</p>
<p>How much do you pay for anonymous tips about kidnappings? Okay, fine.</p>
<p>This one's on me.</p>
<p>You're free to go.</p>
<p>Here's your wallet, keys and pasties.</p>
<p>They're nipple guards for running.</p>
<p>Olympic athletes use them.</p>
<p>I worked at a maximum-security prison, those are the gayest things I've seen.</p>
<p>Well, I find that hard to believe.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, I spoke to the boys' mother, she's not gonna press charges.</p>
<p>Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine.</p>
<p>I spent the night learning arts and crafts from my cellmate, Chabo.</p>
<p>Did you know you can make an ashtray using a snitch's forehead? Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, Shirley, I'm sorry I tried to capitalize on your situation with Chang.</p>
<p>Apology accepted.</p>
<p>Punishment is time served.</p>
<p>There's no cell that can hold Chang.</p>
<p>Cut it out, get down the hallway.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Winger.</p>
<p>Thank God you're all right.</p>
<p>I've been looking all over Hey, Tracy, what's up, baby? Why are they arresting Chang? Loquanda wasn't pressing charges.</p>
<p>I talked her into going after Chang for child endangerment.</p>
<p>He could get three to five years.</p>
<p>You sure that's what you want? Because if we put our heads together, we could be rid of him for 20 to life.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>I'd testify that he tried to sell those kids to me.</p>
<p>Throw in that he was teaching them Spanish, any DA worth his salt could make a case for trafficking.</p>
<p>I like how you're thinking.</p>
<p>What is wrong with you two? Why are you doing this? I'm doing this for us.</p>
<p>We have a second chance.</p>
<p>I want everything to be perfect.</p>
<p>That's what you wanted the first time around.</p>
<p>You did everything to make everything perfect, and look what happened.</p>
<p>You cheated because I wanted what was best for our family? No.</p>
<p>I cheated because I was a coward.</p>
<p>You took me back because while I was gone you learned to accept the bad with the good.</p>
<p>Oh, that's the Greendale effect.</p>
<p>Our school motto is "lower your standards." </p>
<p>Look, I know you are ashamed about what happened with Chang.</p>
<p>Hell, I am too.</p>
<p>But locking that little man up is not gonna make our lives any less crazy.</p>
<p>It will only make prison crazier.</p>
<p>I guess you're right.</p>
<p>It's impossible to keep the chaos from your lives.</p>
<p>We learned that in that movie we saw with all those dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Jurassic Park? No, It's Complicated.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Time out, okay.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to you, you, Officer Baby.</p>
<p>Let's go, buddy.</p>
<p>No! Come on, you're coming with me.</p>
<p>No! No! Britta? What? You guys want me to ruin something for you? Come on, you're being dramatic.</p>
<p>We asked Lukka a few questions after what you said.</p>
<p>He told us about his time in the army and the things he did I'm never gonna get those images out of my head.</p>
<p>If I go to Balkans, I'm bringing some serious cheat codes.</p>
<p>Why didn't you tell us sooner? I didn't wanna be the one to ruin another guy for you guys.</p>
<p>There's a difference between telling us a guy likes nipple play and telling us a guy makes hats out of babies.</p>
<p>The reason this happened is because we've been riding you hard lately.</p>
<p>How about we promise to go easier on you, if you promise not to tell us about guys you're dating unless they've committed genocide? Or if they're left-handed.</p>
<p>I wanna know.</p>
<p>I'm making a chart.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>I guess I ruined game night.</p>
<p>I tend to ruin stuff.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You do not.</p>
<p>Wanna watch Catfish? That movie where the guy flirts with the girl online, but it turns out that it's a fat, old woman? Oh.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's cool.</p>
<p>Maybe it's about catfish.</p>
<p>Well, this was fun.</p>
<p></p>
