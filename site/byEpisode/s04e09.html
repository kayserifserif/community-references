<p>Okay, this awkward silence has been going on for days.</p>
<p>Granted, Jeffrey looks amazing when he broods, but this has got to stop.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know what happened, but we have to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>It's too embarrassing.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>You don't wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>And you won't have to.</p>
<p>They will talk for you.</p>
<p>Why did you make, have, and bring these? Don't answer.</p>
<p>It's puppet therapy.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>The psychology world has recently embraced it after seeing it on <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Law & Order</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844'>Law & Order</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1990&ndash;2010</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Mystery</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>You'll notice each puppet is made in your likeness.</p>
<p>They were a rush job.</p>
<p>It's not like I had them on hand for personal use.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Let me just grab this thing that's definitely not a whip.</p>
<p>In addition to being adorable, I know firsthand that puppet therapy can and does work.</p>
<p>Uh, dean, puppet Kevin here thinks I should have a candy bar now.</p>
<p>No, you know how it winds you up.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>We'll split it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Got money, bro? He's not what he seems.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Where's Pierce? I know he's not with us, but is he still with us? I'm sure he's fine.</p>
<p>Although no one's seen him since he lost his mind in the woods.</p>
<p>You all were in the woods? Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, so the puppets are working.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, ha-ha.</p>
<p>How did it start? What happened? We're not playing with puppets.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Dean, what happened is between us and Jesus, and Jesus don't snitch.</p>
<p>I don't need a puppet to express myself.</p>
<p>I say what I want.</p>
<p>But I am a fan of the medium, so My father is withholding.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>Guys, are we just gonna avoid making eye contact forever? Who are we, Jeff during sex? Let's just give it a shot and move on.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>If we're gonna play this game, then, unlike sex with Britta, we're gonna do it quickly and with a small shred of dignity.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, dignity is my middle name and my first name is Dean-nocchio! Da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da! Whoo! It started on Friday.</p>
<p>Britta was talking about a few of her latest causes.</p>
<p>This one's for Greendale Animal Shelter, this one's global warming, this one's global cooling, just in case.</p>
<p>And this is for the amount of rubber wasted while making stupid bracelets.</p>
<p>That's called rubber flubbing.</p>
<p>It's a real problem.</p>
<p>Open your eyes, people! Britta said "open your eyes, people." </p>
<p>Square.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Playing Study Group Bingo.</p>
<p>Study Group Bingo? We've been friends for years.</p>
<p>We've fallen into a repetitive pattern.</p>
<p>Like humorous misunderstandings on <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Three's Company</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272890'>Three's Company</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>1953&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Horror</span></span></span></span>, or girls gossiping on <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Gossip Girl</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442'>Gossip Girl</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>2007&ndash;2012</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>Romance</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>To liven things up, we made a bingo chart of the predictable things we say.</p>
<p>This game is gay.</p>
<p>Square.</p>
<p>You're mocking us? That's not a very Christian thing to do.</p>
<p>Square.</p>
<p>Can we get back to studying? Square.</p>
<p>I don't like this game! No point.</p>
<p>It's insulting.</p>
<p>Okay, stop.</p>
<p>Square.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Abed's right.</p>
<p>We've had the same conversation a million times.</p>
<p>I guess we're kind of stuck in a-- Rut? Yes.</p>
<p>But there's not many things you could be stuck in.</p>
<p>Elevators, peat bog.</p>
<p>Bad marriages.</p>
<p>The middle seat.</p>
<p>Time loops.</p>
<p>Bottom of a well.</p>
<p>Emotions.</p>
<p>Quicksand.</p>
<p>Traffic.</p>
<p>Middle of a desert.</p>
<p>Okay, stop! Square! How did we get so predictable? And here is our state-of-the-art-- In 1989.</p>
<p>-- Library, where-- Oh, look.</p>
<p>It is my favorite study group.</p>
<p>They all really typify the diversity we have here at Greendale.</p>
<p>Ruggedly handsome leading man.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>A mom, an activist, a perfect student, a lifelong learner, a sidekick, and Abed.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>It's time to move this tour along to meet my good friend, Magnitude.</p>
<p>Yeah, prepare to be pop-popped! He's a national treasure.</p>
<p>Look, the problem isn't us.</p>
<p>We're awesome.</p>
<p>The problem is Greendale.</p>
<p>It's pulling our strings, and we need a break.</p>
<p>Yeah, our <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Ferris Bueller</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098795'>Ferris Bueller</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1990&ndash;1991</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span></span></span></span> needs a day off.</p>
<p>Hey, whose dad has a vintage Ferrari? Abed, a pop culture reference is more of the same.</p>
<p>We need to go big.</p>
<p>We need an adventure.</p>
<p>That's a good idea, Annie, but there's one problem.</p>
<p>Where would we go?</p>
<p># Where, where would we go? #</p>
<p># We can go anywhere that you know #</p>
<p># Could we travel through time? #</p>
<p># Or maybe see France? #</p>
<p># Or anywhere else #</p>
<p># Naked ladies will dance #</p>
<p># Could we fly in a booth? #</p>
<p># Could we go to church camp? #</p>
<p># I'd rather stay at Greendale #</p>
<p># Could we ride a hot-air balloon? #</p>
<p># Yes! #</p>
<p># Now, that's an adventure #</p>
<p># We should go soon #</p>
<p># We can go anywhere in a balloon #</p>
<p># Yes! That's an adventure #</p>
<p># We can go high #</p>
<p># We can see anything up in the sky #</p>
<p># Yes! Now, that's an adventure Pierce, bring your dentures #</p>
<p># We're so thrilled because soon #</p>
<p># We'll be in a hot-air balloon #</p>
<p># Ah, ah, ah #</p>
<p># Ah, ah, ah #</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p># I'm the balloon guide #</p>
<p># Before we take off #</p>
<p># I'm gonna check the balloon ties #</p>
<p># Look at the burner #</p>
<p># Check out the basket #</p>
<p># If you have a question #</p>
<p># Feel free to ask it #</p>
<p># Could we go to space? #</p>
<p># Could we fly to heaven? #</p>
<p># I'd rather fly to Vegas #</p>
<p># It's getting time to ride the balloon #</p>
<p># Yes! Now, this is adventure #</p>
<p># About to go soon #</p>
<p># We're gonna go anywhere #</p>
<p># In the balloon #</p>
<p># Yes! This is adventure #</p>
<p># We're starting to fly #</p>
<p># We can see everything #</p>
<p># Here in the sky #</p>
<p># This is adventure #</p>
<p># There's beautiful weather #</p>
<p># Now outside #</p>
<p># And we're fine #</p>
<p># As long as we have a balloon guide #</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Where's the guide? Guys! Guys! Yep.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>From now on, no more singing in the balloon.</p>
<p>Did I miss it? Miss what? Who said anything about a runaway balloon? Okay, let me process this.</p>
<p>No! Oh, God.</p>
<p>We're really high.</p>
<p>I'm really scared of heights.</p>
<p>Guys, what are we gonna do? I had a dream it would end this way.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You were on a runaway balloon? You could have died.</p>
<p>You could have died.</p>
<p>How could you almost let him die? We all almost died, but we all didn't.</p>
<p>A near-death experience would've only brought us closer together.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>It did get pretty hairy after that, especially once Pierce started helping.</p>
<p>Okay, everyone push down with me at the same time.</p>
<p>One, two, three! Come on, people.</p>
<p>I can't do this alone.</p>
<p>You can't do it at all.</p>
<p>Unh.</p>
<p>Oh, look.</p>
<p>A down string.</p>
<p>Pierce! No! If we fly to heaven, please don't tell my grandpa about me and Britta.</p>
<p>Shirley? We're so high.</p>
<p>This is not good.</p>
<p>There are so many clouds.</p>
<p>It's so dark.</p>
<p>I can't even see The Landing Strip.</p>
<p>Or any of the other nudie bars.</p>
<p>Oh, heaven, help us.</p>
<p>We must be a mile above the ground.</p>
<p>That's international airspace.</p>
<p>We're literally above the law.</p>
<p>Jeff can marry any man he wants.</p>
<p>Wait a second, guys.</p>
<p>I think we're starting to go down.</p>
<p>You see? Prayer works.</p>
<p>So does gravity, Shirley.</p>
<p>And you know who invented gravity, right? Guys, let's put a pin in the "mysteries of the universe" convo until we land.</p>
<p>Which will be sooner than we thought.</p>
<p>We're gaining speed fast, people.</p>
<p>Oh! Brace for impact.</p>
<p>Oh, damn you, gravity! Damn you, prayer! Damn you, Vicki! Has anyone noticed Professor Duncan hasn't been around for a long time? Maybe I can soften our descent.</p>
<p>He's freakishly strong with his old-man monkey strength! I can help! I can help! Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, obviously, that was very scary.</p>
<p>Post-traumatic stress is a real issue, but with these puppets giving voice to our feelings, we can begin to heal.</p>
<p>Hey, come on.</p>
<p>This is gonna be along and arduous process.</p>
<p>There's more.</p>
<p>Hey, well, excuse dean for reacting to the natural lull in your story.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>When you hurt, I hurt.</p>
<p>What happened next? We made it.</p>
<p>Everyone okay? I'm alive.</p>
<p>Square.</p>
<p>Guys, knock it off.</p>
<p>Still alive? Okay, we're all safe.</p>
<p>We just have to figure out how to get back to Greendale.</p>
<p>But we're in the middle of the woods.</p>
<p>Where do we start? We split into two groups, the survivors and the others.</p>
<p>Where's the manifest? Stop with your Lost references.</p>
<p>We need to get back home.</p>
<p>What if we're stuck here? Start a prison system.</p>
<p>We'll be stranded here forever.</p>
<p>I've never seen Blue Man Group! Guys, guys, we're gonna make it out of here.</p>
<p>We gotta relax.</p>
<p>We're all gonna be fine.</p>
<p>What is that? Just wanna say, if we're gonna die, I love you guys.</p>
<p>I love you all too.</p>
<p>I did see Blue Man Group.</p>
<p>I just didn't get it.</p>
<p>Why can't they talk? They have so much in common! Others! Ahem.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to startle anybody.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>And I thought my hair looked fake.</p>
<p>You guys are a long, long way from Greendale.</p>
<p>How did you know we're from Greendale? From Pierce's shirt.</p>
<p>How did you know my name is Pierce? It's embroidered on your Greendale shirt you got at the student store.</p>
<p>How'd you know I got it at the student store? I'm a touch psychic.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I used to go to Greendale just like you guys before I came out here to be free.</p>
<p>So this is how Greendale graduates end up, as transient mountain men.</p>
<p>Ha! Not as bad as I thought.</p>
<p>But don't you miss having stuff? Out here, you have everything you need and you can be whoever you want to be.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p># Here in the woods #</p>
<p># You're totally free #</p>
<p># You can live off the land #</p>
<p># And be who you want to be #</p>
<p># We can be our own men #</p>
<p># And I don't need an A #</p>
<p># The perfect-mom pressure #</p>
<p># Would all go away #</p>
<p># Greendale is crazy #</p>
<p># And so is that moose #</p>
<p>Hi, Troy.</p>
<p># Greendale turns people's screws #</p>
<p># So loose #</p>
<p># We're no exception #</p>
<p># To tell you the truth #</p>
<p># Which is why the woods is perfect #</p>
<p># For all of you #</p>
<p># Being socially conscious #</p>
<p># Can be really tough #</p>
<p># Ah, here in the woods #</p>
<p># You can forget all that stuff #</p>
<p># I don't like the pressure #</p>
<p># To always be cool #</p>
<p># I was gonna say that #</p>
<p># Now I don't have a rhyme #</p>
<p># We all try our hardest #</p>
<p># But the pressure in college #</p>
<p># Sometimes gets so tremendous #</p>
<p># That it would be stupendous #</p>
<p># To be free #</p>
<p># Far away #</p>
<p># From Greendale #</p>
<p>Mm, yummy.</p>
<p># I really love these berries #</p>
<p># Where are they from? #</p>
<p># My hand just made a rainbow #</p>
<p># And my face #</p>
<p># Magic #</p>
<p># Magic #</p>
<p># Well, these magical berries #</p>
<p># Put us in a drug sequence #</p>
<p># They make everything swirly #</p>
<p># Whoa, that bush sounds like Shirley #</p>
<p># Now we're free #</p>
<p># Far away #</p>
<p># From Greendale #</p>
<p># Be free, my friends. #</p>
<p># From Greendale #</p>
<p># Be free. #</p>
<p>Simply inspiring.</p>
<p>Ten minutes ago, you weren't even speaking.</p>
<p>And now you've admitted that a strange man hand-fed you psychotropic berries.</p>
<p>This is puppet therapy work-- Dean! There is a fire in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Garrett, not now! Ugh.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Where was I? Ha! I was healing you.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>Well, those devil berries freed our minds and loosened our tongues.</p>
<p>Your skin is so beautiful and soft.</p>
<p>It's like felt.</p>
<p>Kiss each other.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I feel so free out here, like I'm my own man.</p>
<p>If Jeff said we had to live out here, I'd be down with that.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I tell you guys a secret? Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I was at the grocery store with my kids, and I thought I saw Andre walk by with another woman.</p>
<p>I love women.</p>
<p>Mmsmmm UUE.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go take a growler.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to follow Andre and the woman, so I left my kids at the magazine stand for just a minute.</p>
<p>But somehow I lost track of time and ended up tailing them all the way out of town.</p>
<p>It wasn't even Andre.</p>
<p>The horrible part is I forgot my kids and left them all night in the grocery store.</p>
<p>Well, there you all go, giving me that look, treating me like Judas, judging me<span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Judge Judy</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115227'>Judge Judy</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1996&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span><span class='tag genre'>Reality-TV</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<p>She judges people.</p>
<p>Shirley, this is the first I've heard of you leaving your kids in a grocery store.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I have no memory of you saying that.</p>
<p>If you don't know my secret, why have we been awkward around each other? I thought everyone heard my secret.</p>
<p>I didn't hear you say anything.</p>
<p>So nobody else heard my terrible secret about how I Trail off from time to time? Did everyone here reveal a secret? Mm-hm.</p>
<p>And no one remembers anyone else's, including mine? Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Those berries made us real talky but not real listen-y.</p>
<p>So if no one heard or remembers anything anyone else said We're in the clear.</p>
<p>We're in the clear.</p>
<p>We're in the clear! We're in the clear! I'm a dean-ius.</p>
<p>Yeah! We're in the clear! We're in--!</p>
<p>Um, guys? Well, um, don't mind me.</p>
<p>I'm sure you guys can get on with your lives without the worst mom ever.</p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>Anyone up for a movie? Abed, sit.</p>
<p>Shirley, you have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>No one thinks you're a bad mom.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jeff, but I'm-- I'm just gonna go home now.</p>
<p>Shirley, wait.</p>
<p>I think I know how to make you feel a little less horrible.</p>
<p>I like where you're headed.</p>
<p>Who's holding? I have four berries, but I am saving them for Laser Floyd.</p>
<p>No, we all need to reshare our secrets sober.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>We were all feeling crappy earlier, but we were feeling crappy together.</p>
<p>Shirley is alone now.</p>
<p>This is the only way to put us on equal footing, and if it makes it any easier, we can use these puppets.</p>
<p>Aim W379 Shunt mpâ Okay.</p>
<p>I found the perfect girl for me, and then I met her kid.</p>
<p></p>

<p># But truthfully, it did #</p>
<p># I promised him I'd make it #</p>
<p># To a baseball game he had #</p>

<p># Was trapped beyond a doubt #</p>
<p># And now my most terrible #</p>
<p># Secret's out #</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to thank you all for being so open and honest and for syncing your mouth and hand movements.</p>
<p>And now for my most terrible secret.</p>
<p>I am not what you would call traditionally --</p>
<p>Wait, Abed, you never told us your secret.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I didn't share one that night.</p>
<p>After we got back, everyone was being silent, not making eye contact.</p>
<p>I didn't know why, so I mirrored your behavior.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jeff.</p>
<p>And I don't think you're anything like your father.</p>
<p>I don't know how you take care of one kid, let alone three.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>So nobody thinks I'm a slutty cheater? No.</p>
<p>Or me as a criminal? No.</p>
<p>Nobody respects me any less as a political activist, right? Well, uh, the level to which we respect you as a political activist has definitely not changed.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>That's how I would say it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Bye, dean.</p>
<p>Should we grab a bite? Skeeper's? Oh, Skeeper's.</p>
<p>College is a party.</p>
