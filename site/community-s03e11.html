<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Hot 'n' Brown's coffee really wakes me up to the fact that its coffee sucks.</p>
<p>I miss having a coffee shop.</p>

It wasn't that great.</p>
<p>If had this space, I would have served fresh fruit and sandwiches, and I would've got rid of that take-a-penny, leave-a-penny nonsense.</p>
<p>If the good lord wanted you to have a penny, you'd have one.</p>
<p>Pierce, why do you look like a wealthy murderer?</p>
<p>I look like an entrepreneur. Now that my dad's gone, I'm expanding Hawthorne industries by investing in new products.</p>
<p>Like these.</p>
<p>What's that? It's an automatic security camera that can tell your friends from intruders.</p>
<p>How does it work? Your guests have arrived.</p>
<p>Threat level four.</p>
<p>Your guests have arrived.</p>
<p>It's not calibrated.</p>
<p>Wireless racism.</p>
<p>The future of the past is now.</p>
<p>Why don't you put your money into a good idea, like Shirley? Oh, I made that offer the first day I met her.</p>
<p>She almost broke my nose.</p>
<p>I mean, Shirley's good with food, you have capital, and Greendale has real estate.</p>
<p>What are you talking about, Britta? I'm talking about the whole reason you came here - To start a business.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>What do you think, Shirley? Should I have my people call your people? I mean, not your people.</p>
<p>I could think about it.</p>
<p>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh is Shirley Bennett in the house? Bop motown philly back again the year was 1991.</p>
<p>Ah -- ooh Andre, what are you doing here? Oh! Boyz II Men, going on not too hard spring fling dance.</p>
<p>See, that's where I first laid eyes on Shirley Edwards.</p>
<p>A vision in hyper color and hammer pants.</p>
<p>Baby girl, I have loved you ever since there was a Soviet Union - and only one Damon Wayans.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Baby, I know I've made mistakes, but I'm so happy we've made it through.</p>
<p>But there's one thing, something important, that we keep putting off.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Will you, Shirley Bennett, marry me, Andre Bennett, again? Yes, yes, again! Shall I notify authorities?</p>
<p>It's cool that Andre and Shirley are getting married again.</p>
<p>There's a whole generation of viewers that didn't get to see the original.</p>
<p>Let's hope it's more of a bale than a Kilmer situation.</p>
<p>Second weddings are okay, I guess.</p>
<p>If I had to rank 'em, uh, it would go fourth, seventh, second, fifth, first, third, sixth.</p>
<p>No, wait, first then fifth.</p>
<p>Got it. Fourth, seventh, second, first, fifth, third, sixth.</p>
<p>When's our culture gonna outgrow this wedding thing? You're anti-wedding, now? No, she's just pro-anti.</p>
<p>No to everything you both said.</p>
<p>Weddings are like little girls' tea parties, except the women are the stuffed animals, the men are making them talk, and they're not drinking tea, they're drinking antiquated gender roles.</p>
<p>Somebody tell Britta what an analogy is.</p>
<p>I know what it is.</p>
<p>It's like a thought with another thought's hat on.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Look, I can't get behind this marriage thing, either.</p>
<p>It was invented back when "till death" meant "till your first cold." </p>
<p>I mean, life's too long to spend it with someone else.</p>
<p>It's a sucker's game.</p>
<p>It's a mutual cop out.</p>
<p>I mean, just nut up and die alone.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, we're so happy for you! - You are glowing.</p>
<p>I know, isn't it exciting? The rehearsal is in two days, and the wedding is the day after that, on our anniversary.</p>
<p>And I'm sure you all can make it, because you're already here.</p>
<p>You're having your wedding in the study room? Our church has certain policies regarding things like second weddings, and tight jeans and Calico cats.</p>
<p>Um, Jeff, I was wondering if you would do us the honor of giving a toast at our wedding? Good idea! Jeff has a lot of thoughts about marriage.</p>
<p>I would be honored.</p>
<p>Shirley, do you need any help with your wedding? This probably sounds silly, but every time I see a wedding idea I like, I put it in a little scrapbook.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>We can help too.</p>
<p>We just saw the Inspector Spacetime wedding episode, so we know what pitfalls to avoid.</p>
<p>Be sure to get a DNA reading of your prospective mate.</p>
<p>Inspector Spacetime ended up marrying himself as a baby.</p>
<p>I think I got this.</p>
<p>Everyone just come and relax and behave normally.</p>
<p>That's the noise people make when they're offended in all the movies that Annie rents.</p>
<p>We'll try not to embarrass you at your community college library wedding.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, Shirley, I managed to set up a meeting with the Dean, so we can pitch him our sandwich shop idea.</p>
<p>I've already registered a website It's, uh, h-t-t-p, colon, forward slash, forward slash, w-w-w, period, members, period, webplicity custom sites, all one word period, c-o --</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know, Pierce.</p>
<p>I'm way too busy for that now with the wedding and everything.</p>
<p>Bye-bye, everybody.</p>
<p>I have to practice my walk.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Another business venture down the toilet.</p>
<p>No problem, I've still got plan "C." </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the trouser bench.</p>
<p>For the man on the go who makes frequent stops.</p>
<p>Will somebody please call all the ambulances? I can't believe Shirley.</p>
<p>We should show up at this wedding and be the most normal people in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could go as Normal Man and you could be my trusty sidekick Ordinario.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's already weird.</p>
<p>We'd be playing into her hand.</p>
<p>We should just show up wearing boring gray suits with gray ties and gray shirts.</p>
<p>We could dye our hair gray.</p>
<p>And then we could lay down on the sidewalk and be invisible.</p>
<p>You know, maybe Shirley's got a point.</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>What if we purged all the weirdness from our systems?</p>
<p>You mean -- </p>
<p>A full 24-hour weird-down in the Dreamatorium.</p>
<p>Just you, me, and our imaginations no restraints.</p>
<p>By the wedding, our temptation to act weird will be gone.</p>
<p>I'm feeling more normal already.</p>
<p>Crab walk home? - Yeah.</p>
<p>Shirley, my ninth-grade English teacher used to say, "There will always be a reason not to follow your dreams." </p>
<p>At the time, he meant I was under the age of consent.</p>
<p>But his words still apply.</p>
<p>Are you sure your wedding is the reason you're bailing on this business with Pierce?</p>
<p>Uh, in the words of my ninth-grade English teacher, "You are dippin' and dappin' and don't know what's happenin'." </p>
<p>Fine, we both went to public school.</p>
<p>It's just that I don't want to see you slide into your old comfort zone.</p>
<p>You don't know that.</p>
<p>I am gonna start a business soon! I can't help it if I have floral arrangements to pick and a DJ to hire --</p>
<p>Shirley, if that really is your excuse, I will plan your wedding for you! </p>
<p>Ooh-hoo! Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, my good God.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>I was serious.</p>
<p>Britta, you're not planning my wedding.</p>
<p>What if Annie helps? - Oh, hey, guys.</p>
<p>Did someone say "Annie", "help," "wedding," and something about maybe hydrangeas? Shirley, you can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me.</p>
<p>Do not use your second wedding as an excuse to limit yourself.</p>
<p>Pierce, come here.</p>
<p>Shirley, do you take this man to be your business partner? - Mmm, I guess.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I had to shelve the trouser bench anyway.</p>
<p>There are still some parts of the prototype that need to be extracted.</p>
<p>Maybe you're misunderstanding? I mean, from my butt.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Meet Shirley, she's modern, she's urban, she's fun, and she's hungry.</p>
<p>You probably notice she's black, but not a stereotype - Suburban black.</p>
<p>Is she suburban or urban? She's half-urban.</p>
<p>Let's say Writer's secret, bad pitch Her father's a record producer, her mother's a Shirelle.</p>
<p>We're supposed to be preparing a business pitch.</p>
<p>What about revenue projections? What are the margins gonna be? Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley.</p>
<p>Sweet, innocent Shirley.</p>
<p>What was the question? - Look, this was Britta's stupid idea.</p>
<p>I'd rather be with my man, planning my wedding, and you'd clearly rather be with Halle Berry in 1999.</p>
<p>Pleasure not doing busine<span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Halle Berry</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000932">Halle Berry</a></span><span class="years">1966&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">actress</span><span class="tag prof">producer</span><span class="tag prof">executive</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460">tt0246460</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285742">tt0285742</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327554">tt0327554</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348836">tt0348836</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Shirley, Hawthorne wipes fired me.</p>
<p>They were just waiting for my dad to be out of the picture.</p>
<p>I'm not an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I'm just a kid with a bunch of money, I Please, please, help me be somebody.</p>
<p>Let me invest in you.</p>
<p>First thing we need to figure out is our overhead.</p>
<p>Do you have a pen? Yeah.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>These pockets.</p>
<p>Do you know someone that can buy a pen? Yes! Well, have you thought about the color story for your wedding? He means the theme of the wedding.</p>
<p>Right, Dale? - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Same theme as every wedding Conformity, blind participation, and patriarchal - What about pink? - We don't call it pink.</p>
<p>We don't call anything by its name.</p>
<p>That's, like, day-one floral school stuff.</p>
<p>This is citrine.</p>
<p>This is opalescent.</p>
<p>This is sea glass, cameo, and cerulean.</p>
<p>Come on, how difficult is this? You do one of these, one of these, one of these, this one, this one and, like, stick a ribbon on it.</p>
<p>Happy? Britta, that's a really beautiful arrangement.</p>
<p>Color me lavender.</p>
<p>"Lavender" means "impressed." </p>
<p>Yeah, well, great Flowers look good in a pot.</p>
<p>There are people dying in Uganda.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>What! Ugh! - Ahh, ahh, ahh.</p>
<p>Don't eat my skin! I am shaving everything! - Well, that should do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My God, isn't tonight Shirley's wedding rehearsal? Look at how we're dressed.</p>
<p>Yes, this simply won't do.</p>
<p>Let's change into something appropriate for the occasion and be on our way.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Troy and Abed being normal.</p>
<p>Annie! I need your help.</p>
<p>Um, you're, like, sentimental and stuff.</p>
<p>Oh! I'm really having trouble coming up with a toast.</p>
<p>I find that hard to believe, Jeff.</p>
<p>You once convinced Troy that turtlenecks were made of turtles' necks.</p>
<p>It's true, my superpower is that I can assume any position that suits my purpose.</p>
<p>In that example Keeping turtlenecks as an option for myself, down the road.</p>
<p>But I do have a kryptonite.</p>
<p>It's so obvious to me that marriage is dumb, I can't even pretend to get behind it.</p>
<p>You know what I think would make the perfect toast? You, as Shirley's friend and a good guy, just saying what's really in your heart.</p>
<p>There's something real in there.</p>
<p>Maybe that's what scares you.</p>
<p>I could use a drink.</p>
<p>Shirley's sandwiches can offer students more food for less money, and provide the campus with a higher percentage of the profits.</p>
<p>Pierce, put up the next slide.</p>
<p>That's me! Where'd I get all that money I'm holding? I'm gonna tell you the three reasons that Shirley's sandwiches and your cafeteria are going to be successful.</p>
<p>Well, then I'm writing this down, hmm? Wait.</p>
<p>Here's a pen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ooh ooh ooh ooh -  ooh ooh ooh ooh - Holy crap! Britta, you're really good at this.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>What's wrong with you? This may shock you, Annie, but I come from a long line - of wives and mothers.</p>
<p>Many do.</p>
<p>But I ran away from it my whole life.</p>
<p>I refused to give Santa a Christmas list, because I didn't want to depend on any man for anything.</p>
<p>And now, look at me! I'm Betty Crocker.</p>
<p>I'm Martha Stewart.</p>
<p>I'm one of the Steppenwolf wives.</p>
<p>Ohh, God.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make some man very <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Steppenwolf</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072206">Steppenwolf</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1974&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Drama</span></span></span></span>ay.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Slow down.</p>
<p>What's with you guys? We de-whimsified ourselves.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We're normal now.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Good? Hey, anybody seen Shirley? What? Shirley's late to the rehearsal for her wedding? Oh, my.</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>You don't have to be sarcastic.</p>
<p>I'm not being sarcastic.</p>
<p>We're heavily invested in your situation.</p>
<p>Nothing's more important to us than your second wedding's rehearsal going smoothly.</p>
<p>Walk away, man.</p>
<p>Hey! Did you think of a toast? Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, I had a drink, and I looked in my heart, and here's what I got so far. </p>
<p>"Webster's dictionary defines --"</p>

<p>Yeah, well, it's all I got.</p>
<p>That took me eight hours and six macallan neatses.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry, I just don't believe in marriage.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>It's inevitable.</p>
<p>And then I'd put a counter across here and the ovens there.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>And how fiscal will the quarterly earnings be? Well, initially, the fiscal Wait, that question makes no sense.</p>
<p>Ah! I know.</p>
<p>I just want to sound as good at business as you are.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn't say this, but I cannot believe you learned all this at Greendale.</p>
<p>You're very professional.</p>
<p>I am, aren't I? I brought sodas, so we can toast to our futures.</p>
<p>Look at me now, dad.</p>
<p>Dad? Oh, my God, I'm supposed to be looking like a bride for my wedding rehearsal to the dad of my children.</p>
<p>That was an odd dot to connect.</p>
<p>Give me another.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>What's with you? This is who I am.</p>
<p>Andre, sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>I have wonderful news.</p>
<p>Where were you? - Uh, getting wonderful news.</p>
<p>The Dean loved our pitch and --</p>
<p>Your pitch? Woman, I've been waiting for you for two hours.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Has it been that long? I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>Don't you dare use your sexy voice on me.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>It's just a rehearsal.</p>
<p>Lord knows we've done it before.</p>
<p>That's not the point.</p>
<p>Shirley, I thought this wedding was supposed to be the start of us getting back to normal.</p>
<p>Back to normal? - Yes.</p>
<p>I need to not be Mr. Mom anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, I got to get back to my stereo business.</p>
<p>You know my store's been struggling.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Andre, but "normal" went out the door the day you did.</p>
<p>Well, if we can't get back to the way things were, why the hell are we getting remarried? Oy -- these shrimp are to die for.</p>
<p>Yah, yah, yah! Yah, yah, yah! Walk the plank.</p>
<p>I think you've mistaken us for pirates.</p>
<p>We are community college students.</p>
<p>Abed, I just had an odd thought.</p>
<p>What if once you go from being weird to normal, you can never go back to being weird again? That is an odd thought.</p>
<p>Well, let's hope it's the last.</p>
<p>Cheers to that, my everyday friend.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Shirley asked me to say something nice at her wedding.</p>
<p>This is the rehearsal.</p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard! Those teenage girls you play ping-pong with are doing it ironically.</p>
<p>Well! I searched my heart for something nice to say at a wedding.</p>
<p>And I found nothing, so I had a drink.</p>
<p>And then I looked real hard.</p>
<p>And you know what I found? My daddy said he would stay with my mommy forever, and he left! Marriage is a lie! Nobody commits to this! Nobody stays with anybody forever, so why do we keep lying? I'm gonna stay with somebody forever.</p>
<p>It's in my stupid DNA.</p>
<p>I was born to be a wife and that's all I'm ever gonna be! You expect anyone here to believe that? I don't care if anybody believes it, jackass! - It's a fact! - Prove it, ding dong! There are a lot of layers to this.</p>
<p>It's almost too conceptual to follow, but I love it.</p>
<p>So that's what this was all about, Andre? Just about wanting me back in the kitchen? I thought you loved being a wife and a mother.</p>
<p>Of course, but can't you see that's not all I'm about anymore.</p>
<p>Hi, sorry, don't want to interrupt.</p>
<p>But you are cordially invited to prevent a disaster.</p>
<p>I promise to put your dreams before mine.</p>
<p>I promise to bottle up my repulsion at the sight of your hair in the drain.</p>
<p>I promise to earn no more than at the same job.</p>
<p>What about babies? - What about 'em? - How many? - Pick a number, dick! Like, it's up to me! What in God's name are you two doing? Getting married.</p>
<p>What does it look like we're doing? You two are damn fools.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>I'll allow it.</p>
<p>I am a fool.</p>
<p>I was a fool to think I wasn't destined for a life of this.</p>
<p>I mean, look around.</p>
<p>Can you even imagine what kind of wedding I could throw if I actually gave a crap? - No offense.</p>
<p>Knock it off.</p>
<p>Being good at weddings doesn't make you good at marriage.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>People can make all sorts of promises, but they never stick it out.</p>
<p>It's not something you just stick out, man, all right? It's a risk that you take together.</p>
<p>And you don't just promise it once.</p>
<p>You got to promise it every day.</p>
<p>Yes, but the person you're making promises to is going to change.</p>
<p>You have to accept that.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>But do you promise to be patient when that person's stereo business takes a little while - to get off the ground.</p>
<p>I do, but --</p>
<p>Do you accept that ten years is more than a little while and that iPods aren't going away, and maybe it's time to let somebody else take the lead? I do.</p>
<p>You do? Yes, baby, I swear I do.</p>
<p>Then I promise I will do whatever it takes to make this work forever.</p>
<p>Oh! Well, in that case, let's rehearse this bad boy.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Actually, you pretty much just married each other.</p>
<p>If you let me pronounce you man and wife, you can kiss the bride and you can save like, um, - What do you say, baby? - Mmm.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Done and done.</p>
<p>Husband and wife.</p>
<p>Now how about it? Let's party! Lame.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>Abed! Abed! We're weird.</p>
<p>We need to be weird.</p>
<p>You want to see something weird? Check out this dance.</p>
<p>Uh, what did you call this? The "Lindbergh lean"? What'll they think of next? </p>
<p>Inspector Spacetime --</p>
<p>Ohh, thank the cosmic engineer I found you.</p>
<p>Troy, this is hardly the time.</p>
<p>Or is it hardly the space? Okay, I see what you did there.</p>
<p>But now I have to get back to my Lindbergh lean with, uh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.</p>
<p>Inspector What sort of creature would do a dance called the Lindbergh lean? - Blorgons? - Blorgons.</p>
<p>My name's Danielle.</p>
<p>Constable Reggie, it appears the Blorgons have developed - the ability to take human form.</p>
<p>Weirdos.</p>
<p>Your photonic bowler hat.</p>
<p>Ahh.</p>
<p>Blorgon patrol.</p>
<p>Shirley, I have some good news and bad news.</p>
<p>The good news is the board loved your sandwich shop idea.</p>
<p>The bad news is that they made a few calls and sold the space to subway, the sandwich place.</p>
<p>What? Pierce and I put a lot of work into that idea.</p>
<p>How could you do this, Dean? - I'm sorry! The board went over my head on this one.</p>
<p>And I don't remember being invited to your wedding, so I guess we're even on the hurting-each-other front.</p>
<p>I'm a blast at weddings.</p>
<p>There go all my dreams.</p>
<p>This is just a setback.</p>
<p>You don't have to give up just because of subway.</p>
<p>Guess I better go break the news to Pierce.</p>
