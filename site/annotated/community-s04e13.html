<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Get out of my chair, or I'll have you disbarred.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>That already happened.</p>
<p>Cash.</p>
<p>Tango.</p>
<p>My old partner in my new firm.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Does it get any better? Not unless you leave.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, still got it.</p>
<p>So, ahem, a little birdie told me you're graduating kiddie college.</p>
<p>You must be excited to get that lollipop.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>It's a sticker.</p>
<p>Ha! I know you're busy-- Not.</p>
<p>-- So allow me to whip it out.</p>
<p>Come work with me.</p>
<p>You'll be a full partner, six figures, corner office, three secretaries.</p>
<p>What's that? Not enough money? I'll double it.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>That's how we negotiate.</p>
<p>Lunch? Wow, I drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p>Mark, aren't you worried I'm a little out of practice? Only cases I've tried lately are about sandwiches and yams.</p>
<p>You're a better lawyer when you weren't a lawyer than most lawyers I know.</p>
<p>It's still in you.</p>
<p>I'll give it some thought.</p>
<p>Just shake my hand, idiot.</p>
<p>It's simple.</p>
<p>I like simple.</p>
<p>Take a look around, Winger.</p>
<p>This is your new old life.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>We just had Christmas, and now it's warm outside.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>We just finished Fall-Spring semester.</p>
<p>Bring on Summer-Winter.</p>
<p>I can't wait.</p>
<p>My final class is called Opinions.</p>
<p>Taylor is scheduled to teach.</p>
<p>But I have a rebuttal.</p>
<p>Lucky.</p>
<p>I transferred to Forensics late and got the worst classes.</p>
<p>Skull Fragment Collection, Advanced Advanced Decomp and Intro to Senselessness were full.</p>
<p>I still have a year of AC repair left.</p>
<p>I passed my classes, so I do yoga while teachers write down my wisdoms.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Jeff passed History.</p>
<p>He's graduating early.</p>
<p>I'm totally unprepared to deal with this.</p>
<p>No, Annie, please, don't-- Gotcha! Well, it's official.</p>
<p>It's on a banner.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You worked hard not to work hard to earn that degree.</p>
<p>You took blow-off classes and electives.</p>
<p>What did you end up majoring in? Education.</p>
<p>You had to win.</p>
<p>I was inches from the finish line.</p>
<p>You have so many credits, they have grand-credits.</p>
<p>Just graduate.</p>
<p>When's the graduation ceremony? Never.</p>
<p>It's community college.</p>
<p>You just send in some papers and they stop charging you.</p>
<p>It's moving, in its own way.</p>
<p>So this is it? A banner and soda Troy forgot to bring? No.</p>
<p>As far as graduations go, it's boring but grounded.</p>
<p>I was hoping for more.</p>
<p>Can we walk with you to the dean's office? What, now? No.</p>
<p>I was gonna mail it in next week, or, you know, whenever.</p>
<p>Don't be silly.</p>
<p>We started as a study group, we'll finish as a study group.</p>
<p>All for one, and one dude we can all leave behind.</p>
<p>Everybody, go quickly! Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>All right, Mr. Winger, et al, Britta.</p>
<p>Emotions are running high so I will keep this tight and short.</p>
<p>You always do.</p>
<p>I see you have all the necessary paperwork.</p>
<p>Necessary? You asked for proof of inseam.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>I am gonna miss our playful, "get a room already" banter.</p>
<p>Oh, dean.</p>
<p>I can come back.</p>
<p>No, I can do this.</p>
<p>Just need to sign the old John Dean-cock and you will be graduated.</p>
<p>So this is it? IW! I, uh, expected a little more pageantry.</p>
<p>I'm listening.</p>
<p>Annie's right.</p>
<p>We should throw a party to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>A small one.</p>
<p>Ooh! The teensiest.</p>
<p>Just close friends, a small cake.</p>
<p>Some flowers, an archway.</p>
<p>A string quartet.</p>
<p>He could wear a suit.</p>
<p>Starting to sound like a wedding.</p>
<p>Not a wedding.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just your average diploma signing, to which you're all invited tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tomorrow? Is that enough time to plan a whole wedding? Uh, absolutely.</p>
<p>I'll get my book.</p>
<p>Listen, I can't do a big party.</p>
<p>It's too much.</p>
<p>Oh, I see what's going on here.</p>
<p>This is about you getting cold feet about graduating.</p>
<p>Pshaw.</p>
<p>I've been looking forward to graduation since freshman registration.</p>
<p>I got a job lined up at my old partner's firm.</p>
<p>Well, then, let them eat cake.</p>
<p>It's just I'm worried that the group might not be able to handle it, you know, emotionally.</p>
<p>Everyone wants you to graduate, Jeff.</p>
<p>What about Abed? The stress of me leaving might send him spiraling.</p>
<p>Give him some more credit.</p>
<p>He's really progressed since he opened up to my therapizing.</p>
<p>Do you remember when he wouldn't stop talking about that timeline thing? The one where I lost my arm? And Pierce died.</p>
<p>Annie went insane.</p>
<p>He blamed it all on you throwing some dice.</p>
<p>He has not brought that up in months.</p>
<p>You're right, Britta.</p>
<p>I just need to give Abed a chance.</p>
<p>Then it's settled.</p>
<p>The six of us will take Astronomy.</p>
<p>So you're leaving me out.</p>
<p>We're leaving Jeff out.</p>
<p>I'm not even the one who gets left out anymore.</p>
<p>Everything's Jeff, Jeff-- Jeff! This seat taken? Oh, you! So everyone excited about the big shindig? Totally.</p>
<p>I was worried about the wedding-graduation mash-up, but it's testing well with women.</p>
<p>Oh, that's a load off.</p>
<p>Hey, we should probably figure out who's bringing the soda.</p>
<p>Just so there's not another hang-up.</p>
<p>I brought it.</p>
<p>I just drank it all.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>I've got it covered.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You've already done so much.</p>
<p>Besides, I think I have a fun and fair way to decide which of the six of us will bring the soda.</p>
<p>We'll roll for it.</p>
<p>It didn't land on a number.</p>
<p>That probably means nothing.</p>
<p>Or it means everything.</p>
<p>Let's hope not.</p>
<p>I'll bring the soda.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>I'll make sure there aren't any hang-ups.</p>
<p>Must I bear this cross forever? I was hoping for more.</p>
<p>Catherine? Do not even tell me you dropped that cake.</p>
<p>Parasites.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What's going on? Why are you trying to avoid graduating? I wish I knew.</p>
<p>I think it's because you're scared to take this law job with your old partner.</p>
<p>But don't let that stop you from graduating.</p>
<p>Take the job, don't take the job.</p>
<p>Either way, your friends are always here to support you.</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>See you at graduation.</p>
<p>And they call us the worst.</p>
<p>Took you long enough.</p>
<p>Nobody said you had to travel naked.</p>
<p>Oh, you brought the good one.</p>
<p>You hold that, I'll do the sleeve.</p>
<p>Wait for the click.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Ahh.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Middle finger works great now.</p>
<p>It's worse than I thought.</p>
<p>They made Lame Jeff too lame to leave Greendale.</p>
<p>He's got to take that job.</p>
<p>But how do we make him do that? By turning the study group against him so he'll run screaming from this rancid cocoon into the welcoming arms of darkness.</p>
<p>How hard is that to understand? It's not.</p>
<p>I just like when you talk down to me like a child.</p>
<p>Oh! Jeff! It's bad luck to see the graduation before the graduation.</p>
<p>I had to talk to you.</p>
<p>Today is bringing up so many emotions.</p>
<p>It's a lot to take in.</p>
<p>I'm not making you feel nervous about graduating, am I? Well, you are making me feel something.</p>
<p>And it's not about graduating.</p>
<p>I'm saying I'm hot for you.</p>
<p>Me? Heh.</p>
<p>Is this for real? Is my beating heart for real? Oh, Annie.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's the beautiful decorations or the impending floral archway, but there's something about this that feels so right.</p>
<p>This is the perfect moment to remember you by.</p>
<p>Remember me by? I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You're going nowhere.</p>
<p>I'm about to return to my cool, adult lawyer life.</p>
<p>You're gonna be stuck here playing high school.</p>
<p>Why are you saying this? So you face the facts.</p>
<p>Once I graduate, I'm gone.</p>
<p>Winger, streaking on your last day of school? Respect.</p>
<p>Oh, so I got the save-the-date for your graduation.</p>
<p>Should I bring a date or try to hook up there? I'm not going to your stupid graduation, jerk.</p>
<p>I can't believe you said those things to me.</p>
<p>What things? Don't play dumb.</p>
<p>You wanna leave? Leave.</p>
<p>See if I care.</p>
<p>What did you do? I have no earthly idea.</p>
<p>Hook up there.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hello, Abed.</p>
<p>Hello, Evil Jeff.</p>
<p>What? How did you-- ? I know an evil doppelgÃ©nger when I see one.</p>
<p>Plus, your arm makes noise.</p>
<p>Silence! Are you here to kill Jeff? Oh, you non-evils are so naive.</p>
<p>I'm here to save Jeff from the smothering teat of his study group.</p>
<p>Is that a paintball gun? You wish.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Cold.</p>
<p>How did I get to the dean's office? Hi.</p>
<p>Out of my chair, monkey.</p>
<p>The darkest timeline.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>Um, okay, let's start with "huh?" Jeff, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I made it all up.</p>
<p>I've been so upset about you graduating that I've gone a little crazy, emotionally.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>I thought I was losing my mind.</p>
<p>Make it up to you with a hug? This breakfast-sandwich cart is such a great idea.</p>
<p>It's never too early for Shirley to make a boatload off of college kids.</p>
<p>Speaking of great-idea-having, hear me out.</p>
<p>It's called the Troy-jan Horse.</p>
<p>It goes bread, lettuce, ham, ham, bacon, chocolate-- Oh, how you doing, the graduate? Just stopping by to hand out some un-vites to my graduation.</p>
<p>Here's one for the desperate housewife who spends more time with her pathetic business than her family.</p>
<p>And you.</p>
<p>If you call a sandwich a Troy-jan Horse, people are gonna think there's horse in it.</p>
<p>Oh, my dreams.</p>
<p>Whatever, losers.</p>
<p>See you never.</p>
<p>Where's Abed? Is anyone here? Hello, Abed.</p>
<p>Welcome to our home.</p>
<p>Hello, Evil Abed.</p>
<p>It's Abed.</p>
<p>After we met, I abandoned my evil goal to focus on brightening my own timeline.</p>
<p>Do you live here alone? Yes.</p>
<p>Evil Troy moved out when I gave up the cause.</p>
<p>He only listens to Evil Jeff, who took over this year, villain-wise.</p>
<p>Jeff left Greendale and became a lawyer, but the more evil he got, the more he became tortured by the idea that there's a good Jeff out there.</p>
<p>Forced me to show him how to travel between timelines.</p>
<p>My God.</p>
<p>This is so cool.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You have no idea how long I've been waiting to talk.</p>

<p>The Cape was canceled.</p>
<p>Not here.</p>
<p>They retooled it for cable and it's awesome.</p>
<p>Wanna see it? Desperately.</p>
<p>But I need to get back to my timeline and stop Evil Jeff.</p>
<p>Came to the person who could help.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>I'll get you home, Abed.</p>
<p>But first, you'll need some supplies.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Everyone must be running late.</p>
<p>Here, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>You're graduated.</p>
<p>Take your precious diploma and just go.</p>
<p>I cannot believe the hurtful things you said to me in my office.</p>
<p>I'll have you know that wanting pageantry in your life isn't a crime or a lifestyle choice.</p>
<p>Okay, Annie, something definitely weird is happening.</p>
<p>No one's here, the dean is mad at me, and he is never mad at me, and a third reason.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Jeff.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the study group.</p>
<p>You can talk to them later.</p>
<p>Why don't you and I go celebrate someplace private and boozy? Annie, why are you acting like a mistress in a Lifetime movie? Heh.</p>
<p>You're funny.</p>
<p>Oh, sweetheart, you dropped your phone earlier.</p>
<p>You've got a voice-mail from a guy named Mark? You should call him.</p>
<p>I have to find the others and figure this out.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>We're losing him.</p>
<p>What? "What?" Who are you? You're me? "Who are you? You're me?" But how? "But how?" Enough of the pleasantries.</p>
<p>I've come from the darkest timeline to make sure you take that job.</p>
<p>It's essential to our future.</p>
<p>You want it, idiot, so take it.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>I've spent almost four years here, growing and changing and making dioramas.</p>
<p>I'm not that guy anymore.</p>
<p>You're wrong.</p>
<p>Greendale may have dulled your killer instinct, but trust me, it's still in you.</p>
<p>It's time to leave this place and reclaim your proper life.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Not without my study group.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Now who's in a Lifetime movie? Then I'll be rid of you another way.</p>
<p>Friendship! Mm.</p>
<p>Cold.</p>
<p>Well, the subtle approach failed.</p>
<p>What's next? Explain it slowly.</p>
<p>Need some help? Let's burn this mother down.</p>
<p>Jeff must be graduating about now.</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone's there.</p>
<p>Doubt he cares.</p>
<p>Pierce won't even respond to my texts.</p>
<p>I wonder what terrible things Jeff said about him.</p>
<p>I've got some guesses.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Look, I know this may sound crazy and more than a little convenient, but whatever I said to you, it wasn't me.</p>
<p>It was Evil Jeff.</p>
<p>Ha! Come on.</p>
<p>Something happened when I rolled that die.</p>
<p>Something only nerds understand.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>You have to believe me.</p>
<p>They're coming for us.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We're coming for them.</p>
<p>Where you been? Darkest timeline.</p>
<p>You never believe me, so I brought proof.</p>
<p>The doppeldeaner.</p>
<p>Abed brought me here to prove to all of you-- Whoa! I figured these warping guns would convince you.</p>
<p>We've got an inter-dimensional battle on our hands.</p>
<p>Our evil counterparts are waging a war, and it's either us or us.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's light up these dark suckers.</p>
<p>Okay, everyone.</p>
<p>Stay sharp.</p>
<p>If you see yourself, warp on sight.</p>
<p>I'd like to warp myself to a dairy-free mudslide.</p>
<p>Ha, ha! That's just vodka, Shirley.</p>
<p>I know what it is.</p>
<p>Aha! Pierce? We thought you were dead.</p>
<p>Hell, no.</p>
<p>After I got shot, I faked my death to teach you all a lesson.</p>
<p>Lesson about what? Who can remember? It was a year ago.</p>
<p>And yet here you all are, planning an invasion without me.</p>
<p>Again, we thought you were dead.</p>
<p>Listen, I can help you guys beat the Lame Study Group.</p>
<p>Just tell me how this works.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>It's complicated, but basically, the first person to shoot themselves wins.</p>
<p>Winner! Well, that bow tied itself.</p>
<p>Dang, I got hair dye on my coat.</p>
<p>Dang, it's spreading.</p>
<p>Damn it, Britta.</p>
<p>Did you shoot yourself too? Every time.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Don't talk to her like that.</p>
<p>Every time.</p>
<p>We're here.</p>
<p>Scatter.</p>
<p>Get help.</p>
<p>Can't hide forever, Lame Annie.</p>
<p>Just let me shoot you.</p>
<p>You'll love the darkest timeline.</p>
<p>We're sleeping with Jeff there.</p>
<p>What? We are? All the time.</p>
<p>And he loves it.</p>
<p>Nobody sleeps with Jeff.</p>
<p>Not even me.</p>
<p>I've been counting bullets.</p>
<p>One of us is out.</p>
<p>Is it you? Yes.</p>
<p>Why would you tell me that? To sound intimidating? Almost worked.</p>
<p>Bailing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Only Evil Jeff is left.</p>
<p>You've gotta take him out.</p>
<p>Why don't I give him what he wants? Can't give up.</p>
<p>Why not? Because it's not real.</p>
<p>Look around, Jeff.</p>
<p>Haven't you noticed the vending machines are full of meats and eggs? Or that all the background students are attractive women? Hi.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is a world you've created in your own mind.</p>
<p>The real battle is within.</p>
<p>You're afraid to graduate.</p>
<p>You think Greendale has changed you.</p>
<p>Part of you wants Evil Jeff to win.</p>
<p>You could pretend you're the same guy you were.</p>
<p>But you're not.</p>
<p>You're stronger.</p>
<p>You're better.</p>
<p>You have friends.</p>
<p>No, screw that.</p>
<p>You have a family.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>If this is all in my mind, then I don't really need to fight him.</p>
<p>Don't logic this one away from me.</p>
<p>We finally figured out a way to make paintball cool again.</p>
<p>Hey, handsome.</p>
<p>On second thought, who needs to roll a die? And who cares if we have soda? As long as you guys are with me, I have everything I need to graduate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Forget soda.</p>
<p>Friends, Greendalians, human beings, we are gathered here today to honor that sacred and eternal bond between a student and his dean.</p>
<p>Neither time nor distance nor screening one's calls could ever sever what nature herself has ordained.</p>
<p>When two men are drawn-- I'll take it from here.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>I was reaching.</p>
<p>Three and a half years ago, when I came to Greendale, I met six very important people.</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>Burn on Britta.</p>
<p>Sorry, seven.</p>
<p>And meeting these people changed my life.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm so used to being the guy who can talk his way out of anything, but what do you say when you don't want a way out? What you all have done for me is indescribable.</p>
<p>It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>And my love for you is immeasurable, even when you split it seven ways.</p>
<p>Well said, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>If anyone here should have just cause why Jeffrey Tobias Winger should not be graduated, speak now or forever-- Pierce.</p>
<p>You don't have to do this.</p>
<p>I'm ready to graduate.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, I'm ready to graduate first.</p>
<p>Seems oddly appropriate.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Pierce.</p>
<p>Pierce! Perfect.</p>
<p>So, what's next for Jeffrey Winger? I'm thinking I might look into some small local firms.</p>
<p>Use my big mouth to help the little guy.</p>
<p>Oh! Plus, if I stay in town, I can pop by any time I want.</p>
<p>You know, just to settle group arguments about who misses me the most.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p># Troy and Abed in the morning #</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>We've got a jam-packed show.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>Today, as always, we'll be visited by Greendale's king and supreme lord master, Dean Chang.</p>
<p>Looks like he'll be talking about squash.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm super excited for that.</p>
<p>And not only because it's mandatory.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>First, we'll take a spin around the map and find out what's happening in the universes that parallel ours.</p>
<p>Thanks, us.</p>
<p>I'm standing in timeline five where things are pretty much normal.</p>
<p>Normal? Troy, people are on fire in Nairobi.</p>
<p>You call that normal? I've become much more conscious of world issues since Troy and I decided to give our baby an African name.</p>
<p>Isn't that right, Chewbacca? It means "he who hunts bounties." </p>
<p>Back to you.</p>
<p>Wow, it sounds like things are really heating up in Nairobi.</p>
<p>That's nothing compared to the fire in our studio audience.</p>
<p>Hey, idiots.</p>
<p>How many times have I told you the show doesn't really exist? No one's watching.</p>
<p>Duh-doy.</p>
<p>We know.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're just messing around.</p>
<p>See you at lunch, Evil Jeff.</p>
<p>See you at lunch.</p>
<p># Troy and Abed in the morning #</p>
