<div id="transcript">
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>It's that very special time of year, Greendale.</p>
<p>A time for me to remind you that your school acknowledges no specialness to this time of year.</p>
<p>You do, of course, have a constitutional right to lend this season the significance of your choosing in any of our designated holiday zones.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Don't you mean season's greetings? Shirley, you know it's Christmas.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I've learned to be sensitive to other cultures' jealousies.</p>
<p>What are we doing this year? I'm taking a relaxation course next semester.</p>
<p>I was gonna use the break to do the reading in advance.</p>
<p>I'm shutting myself in with my video games.</p>
<p>Fake-murdering people is gonna be my new holiday tradition.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>This is disappointing.</p>
<p>What do you care, Abed? You're Muslim.</p>
<p>Don't your people spend this season writing angry letters to TV Guide? True.</p>
<p>Religiously, I'm Muslim.</p>
<p>But I've always been a fan of Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the most important Christmas in history.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that's why we're all stop-motion animated.</p>
<p>I vote we let it go.</p>
<p>What did you say we were, Abed? We're stop-motion animated.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>I never understand what any of you are saying.</p>
<p>You guys don't see it? I noticed it this morning.</p>
<p>That's how I knew it was special.</p>
<p>We've clearly entered a new medium.</p>
<p>Does "clearly" mean the same thing to you as it does to normal people? It's probably Arabic for "not clearly." </p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Huh? You really expect me to tarnish the high-five for that? You guys really don't see what I'm seeing? That worries me a little.</p>
<p>I think it worries all of us.</p>
<p>Is there something that we can do to help you with your situation, Abed? You could move around more.</p>
<p>Not much point in being animated if you don't.</p>
<p>And I think we should commit to the format.</p>
<p>Starting with a song.</p>
<p>You start.</p>
<p>I'm sure we'll join in.</p>
<p># Give me the snow #</p>
<p># Light up the trees #</p>
<p># Deck every hall #</p>
<p># And wall you can see #</p>
<p># Roast every nut #</p>
<p># Mistle the toe #</p>
<p># This needs to be the best Christmas #</p>
<p># Since the original #</p>
<p># Twenty thousand years from now #</p>
<p># They'll say #</p>
<p># The most successful Christmas #</p>
<p># Was today #</p>
<p>Okay, we got him.</p>
<p>He's down.</p>
<p>Now, how many fingers am I holding up? And, more importantly, are they still made of clay? Three, and I told you, we're not clay.</p>
<p>We're silicone dolls with foam bodies over ball-and-socket armatures.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And publishable.</p>
<p>And you say you have no memory of this morning.</p>
<p>You don't recall the crisis that caused you to take shelter in this delusion.</p>
<p>It's not a delusion.</p>
<p>Very, very publishable.</p>
<p>Abed, I've been a professor of psychology here at Greendale for many years.</p>
<p>And I think I see a solution to this that might also help you with your situation.</p>
<p>I'd like to do extensive sessions with you, including hypnosis.</p>
<p>I don't need therapy.</p>
<p>Nobody said you did.</p>
<p>I just think it would benefit you and, incidentally, me to get to the real meaning of all this.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I need to find the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Well, if I can, everything will go back to normal.</p>
<p>Asterisk.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>The dean says if you don't get help, they might kick you out of school.</p>
<p>Why would I wanna be in a school that hates Christmas? He's got a point.</p>
<p>Kidding.</p>
<p># Sad quick Christmas song #</p>
<p># Sad quick Christmas snowman #</p>
<p># Tragic day gone wrong #</p>
<p># Sad quick Christmas song #</p>
<p>I don't suppose you know the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>Apparently, it means getting fondled by singing mental cases.</p>
<p>My snowman is alive.</p>
<p>I'm not a snowman.</p>
<p>I'm Chang.</p>
<p>What the hell's wrong with you? I thought I made you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you made me need to cry in the shower tonight.</p>
<p>It's a text from Britta.</p>
<p>She says, "The meaning of Christmas is in the study room." </p>
<p>Now that you started it, how about 10 more seconds on the third button, eh? You lied to lure me into group therapy? Surprise.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>You promised not to do that.</p>
<p>Surprise.</p>
<p>Not cool.</p>
<p>Ah, hold on, Abed.</p>
<p>I'm not just a psych professor.</p>
<p>I'm also a Christmas wizard.</p>
<p>You are? I am.</p>
<p>And I can help you find the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>Right, guys? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, this feels safe.</p>
<p>Shut up, Winger.</p>
<p>What do you think, Abed? Christmas wizard.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>I guess I can see that.</p>
<p>Have a seat, then.</p>
<p>Nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>All your friends are here.</p>
<p>They just want to help.</p>
<p>I'm here for the cookies.</p>
<p>So, what do we do? With your permission, I'd like to put you into a state of Christmasnosis and take you on a magic journey.</p>
<p>To Winter Wonderland? Sure.</p>
<p>Your own personal Winter Wonderland.</p>
<p>Come on, everyone.</p>
<p>You all know how magic Christmas journeys work.</p>
<p>You are playing with so much fire.</p>
<p>Shut up, Winger.</p>
<p>Hands on the table.</p>
<p>Eyes closed.</p>
<p>Heads relaxing.</p>
<p>Necks relaxing.</p>
<p>Don't relax Pierce any lower.</p>
<p>Screw you.</p>
<p>Abed, focus on the sound of my voice and let yourself relax.</p>
<p>With each breath, you'll feel It's beginning.</p>
<p>All right, then.</p>
<p>The table's moving.</p>
<p>Like a rocket about to take off.</p>
<p>Now it's leaving the floor as the walls and the ceiling fly away.</p>
<p>We're in outer Christmas space.</p>
<p>There's Planet Holly.</p>
<p>And Planet Jolly.</p>
<p>Oh, and what's that up ahead? Ah.</p>
<p>It's Planet Abed.</p>
<p>Subtle.</p>
<p>We're descending onto Planet Abed now.</p>
<p>It's the most Christmassy planet in the universe.</p>
<p>Its atmosphere is 7 percent cinnamon.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>We're here.</p>
<p>Winter Wonderland.</p>
<p>See how sparkly? What, are you crazy? All I see is the study --</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Sparkly wonderland.</p>
<p>During our journey, you've transformed into Christmas versions of yourselves.</p>
<p>Jeff-in-the-Box.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Troy Soldier.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Do I have a gun? You have a drum.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Britta, you're Britta-Bot.</p>
<p>Uh, just go with it.</p>
<p>Bleep, bloop.</p>
<p>Teddy Pierce.</p>
<p>Bleep, bloop for me too.</p>
<p>Ballerannie.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Baby Doll Shirley.</p>
<p>Baby what? What the hell? Well, we are making fabulous and unexpectedly intense progress.</p>
<p>Now, what I'd like to do is visit the cave of frozen memories.</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>Let's head for the North Pole.</p>
<p>The meaning of Christmas will be there.</p>
<p>Um, well, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, cheers.</p>
<p>And I actually think I know a shortcut to the North Pole through the cave of frozen memor We can take Gumdrop Road and stop at the cave.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it a shortcut, but you got us here, so I'll throw you a bone.</p>
<p># Come with me and walk with me #</p>
<p># And see what we can find #</p>
<p># Accompany me on a journey with me #</p>
<p># Through the wonderland in my mind #</p>
<p>Let's move, folks.</p>
<p>This isn't going to be fun, easy or safe.</p>
<p>Shut up, Winger.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>A journey through Winter Wonderland tends to test your commitment to Christmas.</p>
<p>So when I say test, I mean Wonka-style.</p>
<p>I'm talking dark.</p>
<p>My advice: Stay honest, stay alert, and for the love of God, stay between the gumdrops.</p>
<p>Look up there, Abed.</p>
<p>I think I see the cave of frozen memories.</p>
<p>A great place It's actually the cave of frozen peas.</p>
<p>It's a common mistake.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I got this.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>Abed, did you say my Christmas self was a baby? Are you sure you didn't say I was a Christmas angel? Because you respect me too much to imagine me as a baby.</p>
<p>Maybe if you cry enough, he'll change you.</p>
<p>You know why you were a robot, right? I'm progressive and kick-ass.</p>
<p>How about heartless and godless? I think he gave us random identities.</p>
<p>I mean, me, a ballerina? It's not like I'm that thin and graceful, right? Annie, it's because you're fragile and tightly wound.</p>
<p>Cut the chatter, and keep your eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>We're looking for the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>I happen to know the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>And I'm the only one here that does.</p>
<p>So I would appreciate a level of respect even if I'm a guest in your therapy wonderland.</p>
<p>Therapy? I am freezing Shirley with my wand.</p>
<p>And I am ejecting her from Planet Abed with a remote-control Christmas pterodactyl.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Now we're talking.</p>
<p>Point being, if you're not interested in helping Abed, there's no reason to be here.</p>
<p>Cookies.</p>
<p># Swaddled in her diaper #</p>
<p># High upon her throne #</p>
<p># The queen of Christmas babies #</p>
<p># Thought that Christmas was her own #</p>
<p>That's wonderful.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the magic journey and wrap up.</p>
<p>Some of us have women to sleep with.</p>
<p>You guys hear that? Humbugs.</p>
<p>Humbugs? Yeah, a whole swarm of them.</p>
<p>See? Everyone stay perfectly sincere.</p>
<p>Humbugs are attracted to sarcasm.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Somewhere, <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Tim Burton</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318">Tim Burton</a></span><span class="years">1958&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">producer</span><span class="tag prof">miscellaneous</span><span class="tag prof">director</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487">tt0099487</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121164">tt0121164</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236">tt0408236</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1142977">tt1142977</a></span></span></span></span> got a boner.</p>
<p>Jeff, don't be sarcastic.</p>
<p>Oh, are they on me now? Oh, no.</p>
<p>They're eating him alive.</p>
<p>If only he could find the power to not be a smug douche.</p>
<p>Oh, no can do.</p>
<p>I'm just a horrible guy.</p>
<p>Guess I'll have to go get laid.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Can I sing this one?</p>
<p># Bitter shallow hipster #</p>
<p># Sweater matching socks #</p>
<p># Christmas needs more presence #</p>
<p># Than a haircut in a box #</p>
<p>Annie, nice.</p>
<p>Get what I did with the word "presence"? Carol Canyon.</p>
<p>Instead of oxygen, plants produce Christmas songs.</p>
<p>Will it cost a lot to walk here? No.</p>
<p>Public domain.</p>
<p>You know Jesus was born in the middle of April, right? The church moved his birthday so they could steal the solstice from pagans.</p>
<p>Season's greetings from Britta Perry.</p>
<p>Maybe you could sing a song about it.</p>
<p>I don't sing.</p>
<p>And if I did, I wouldn't sing Christmas songs.</p>
<p>I guess that means you're gonna have me ejected for not loving Christmas enough.</p>
<p>Nope, not for that.</p>
<p>Let's get to the cave of frozen memories.</p>
<p>Man, it is cave-like in here.</p>
<p>What do you mean, cave-like? It's a cave.</p>
<p>Nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>The cave of frozen memories is a safe place where we can observe suppressed experiences without being affected by them.</p>
<p>Can you show me how to do it? Sure.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>I'm focusing on a part of the cave and I'm seeing my 10th Christmas.</p>
<p>All right? Now you try with this morning.</p>
<p>I can't see your 10th Christmas.</p>
<p>How do you know that's you? Well, it's my house on What room are you in? What color are the walls? Our living room.</p>
<p>Cream-colored plaster.</p>
<p>There's an oil painting of a forest above the sofa.</p>
<p>I'm reading Paddington books.</p>
<p>Mom got me Paddington every year.</p>
<p>Where's your dad? It's Christmas.</p>
<p>Where's your dad? I don't know.</p>
<p>We never know.</p>
<p>Mom won't stop crying.</p>
<p>I'm going to America with Grandma.</p>
<p>He is good.</p>
<p>We lost our wizard.</p>
<p>We don't need him, never did.</p>
<p>And nobody needs this cave.</p>
<p>Initiate self-destruct.</p>
<p>Self-destruct initiating.</p>
<p>This slide goes directly to Pine Tree Station.</p>
<p>We can catch a train to the North Pole from there.</p>
<p>The wizard didn't bring us here to find the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>And I can't have anyone going beyond this point that's on his side.</p>
<p>With you to the end, man.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Like I said, I came for the cookies.</p>
<p>Ahh! I'm not ejecting you for not liking Christmas music.</p>
<p>I'm ejecting you for lying to trick me into therapy.</p>
<p>Abed, they will kick you out of school.</p>
<p>I was trying to save you.</p>
<p># Britta-Bot programmed badly #</p>
<p># Wires with fraying ends #</p>
<p># Functioning mad and sadly #</p>
<p># No faith in herself #</p>
<p># Or friends #</p>
<p>Bye, Britta.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>It got real up in that memory cave.</p>
<p>I know, right? Speaking of real, this has been great.</p>
<p>But the cookies are gone, and I have to take a giant leak.</p>
<p>We should be at the North Pole by 9:00 Eastern Candy Time.</p>
<p>You guys see the countryside? There's the Menorah Mountains.</p>
<p>And Jehovah Witness Bay.</p>
<p>Thanks for adding that, man.</p>
<p>This is nicer than all the Christmases I ever celebrated.</p>
<p>But you're Jewish.</p>
<p>On my mom's side.</p>
<p>But my dad's Episcopalian.</p>
<p>And before the divorce, the holidays were a minefield of overlapping rituals.</p>
<p>I like the rituals.</p>
<p>My parents are divorced too.</p>
<p>My mom's Polish.</p>
<p>She loves Christmas.</p>
<p>Every year, she visits on the same day.</p>
<p>December 9th.</p>
<p>Every year, we sit and watch Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer.</p>
<p>Together.</p>
<p>Every year.</p>
<p>But, Abed, today is December 9th.</p>
<p>It's the last day of classes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That can't be right.</p>
<p>She comes every year.</p>
<p>Today must be December 8th.</p>
<p>Because she comes every year.</p>
<p>Okay, Abed.</p>
<p>Time to stop the train.</p>
<p>After you emasculated me in the ice caves, I went to your dorm room.</p>
<p>I know what happened now.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I just need to get to the North Pole.</p>
<p>Abed, there is no North Pole.</p>
<p>We're in the study room, and I'm not a Christmas wizard.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You're a Christmas warlock.</p>
<p>You're trying to destroy Christmas because you blame your sadness on it.</p>
<p>I'm crawling out the window.</p>
<p>No, you're not.</p>
<p>Snap out of it.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Who taught you therapy? Michael Jackson's dad? I am a professional.</p>
<p>And you are tampering with a highly-delicate book deal.</p>
<p>I mean, human being.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Now we're losing him.</p>
<p>I'm on the roof of the train.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Well, I'm teleporting there.</p>
<p>Because I can do that because I'm a wizard.</p>
<p>Bloink.</p>
<p>Abed, there is no train.</p>
<p>This is not real.</p>
<p>I can't hear you.</p>
<p>I'm going to the front car.</p>
<p>You're very clever, but it stops here.</p>
<p>There's no more journey.</p>
<p>It's just you against reality.</p>
<p>And reality always wins.</p>
<p>Abed, I'm unhitching the cars, okay? What? Oh, give me a break.</p>
<p>Do you know what you're doing? Bloink.</p>
<p>We're learning to teleport.</p>
<p>And we're helping our friend find the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>You're actually grabbing me in real life, delinquent.</p>
<p>We'll keep him away, Abed.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Find the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>At the very least take notes.</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>All right, where are we? Christmas train? I didn't wanna go home.</p>
<p>It's depressing there this time of year.</p>
<p>What are we looking at? Santa's workshop.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So meaning of Christmas, right? You see it? Well, can't it just be anywhere? Like, there? Good job, Pierce.</p>
<p>It's the first season of Lost on DVD.</p>
<p>That's the meaning of Christmas? No, it's a metaphor.</p>
<p>It represents lack of payoff.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Thinking there was something you could do to save Christmas, turning yourself into an animated character in search of the holiday's meaning, these were mechanisms you used to escape this.</p>
<p>This Christmas card.</p>
<p>Left where you dropped it on the floor of your dorm.</p>
<p>"Abed, I can't make it this year." </p>
<p>I have a new family now.</p>
<p>You'll meet them one day.</p>
<p>You're a man now.</p>
<p>Take care of Dad.</p>
<p>"Wash your dupa." </p>
<p>Mommy's moved on.</p>
<p>New family.</p>
<p>New life.</p>
<p>There's nothing left to do now but heal.</p>
<p>And share the experience with as many reputable journals as possible.</p>
<p>Great, look what you did to the kid.</p>
<p>What's your article gonna be called? "Worst Shrink Ever"? Hey, this is not my fault.</p>
<p>This is what Christmas does to people.</p>
<p>We put too much meaning into it, and it lets us down.</p>
<p>We beg to differ.</p>
<p>What are you doing back here? Saving Christmas.</p>
<p>Everybody, point your magic Christmas weapons at him.</p>
<p>Oh, brother.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>You are enabling a delusion.</p>
<p>The delusion you're trying to cure is called Christmas, Duncan.</p>
<p>It's the crazy notion that the longest, coldest, darkest nights can be the warmest and brightest.</p>
<p>Yeah, and when we all agree to support each other in that insanity, something even crazier happens.</p>
<p>It becomes true.</p>
<p>Works every year.</p>
<p>Like clockwork.</p>
<p>Try telling that to your catatonic friend.</p>
<p>I got a better idea.</p>
<p>Why don't we sing it? Wait, what? Let's not go overboard.</p>
<p>Will you commit to something? Let's sing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's sing.</p>
<p>Can we sing while we blow Duncan away? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Ow! Ah.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>You start, Britta.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p># Christmastime is a time to sing #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is for #</p>
<p># Christmas can even be #</p>
<p># A Hanukkah thing #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is for #</p>
<p># And for a huge percentage #</p>
<p># Of this God-fearing planet #</p>
<p># It's about the birth of Jesus Christ #</p>
<p># But for the rest of us #</p>
<p># It's still a good time #</p>
<p># To remember #</p>
<p># That it's good to be nice #</p>
<p># Music and cookies #</p>
<p># And liquor and trees #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is for #</p>
<p># Video games for two straight weeks #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is for #</p>
<p># Hanging out with the people you love #</p>
<p># And saying I love you #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is #</p>
<p># That's what Christmas is for #</p>
<p>And Christmas pterodactyl.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Initiate self-destruct.</p>
<p>Don't you think that's a little bit? I get it.</p>
<p>The meaning of Christmas is the idea that Christmas has meaning.</p>
<p>And it can mean whatever we want.</p>
<p>For me, it used to mean being with my mom.</p>
<p>Now it means being with you guys.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lost.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I feel so much better now.</p>
<p>I guess we don't need to be stop motion anymore.</p>
<p>Well, why not just keep it going for the rest of Christmas? It just feels so right.</p>
<p>You ever get the urge to just? Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Oh, there.</p>
<p>I said it.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>We're stop motion again.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Don't worry, man.</p>
<p>I did this.</p>
<p>You did? Yeah, it's cool.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Why? Well, I always liked the way fake food looked on those animated shows.</p>
<p>Get a load of these things.</p>
<p>They stepped up a notch in terms of visual deliciousness.</p>
<p>I know what you mean.</p>
<p>Look at that perfect bite.</p>
<p>It's odd that I see this too though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're weird that way.</p>
<p>I'll say.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>That's better.</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p># Troy and Abed in stop motion #</p>
