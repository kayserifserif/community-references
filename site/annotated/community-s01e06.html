<p>A small, fading remnant of a star.</p>
<p>A white dwarf.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I used a memory technique.</p>
<p>Dwarves hate being called midgets, and midgets are small.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And what does a star turn into after it collapses? A movie of the week.</p>
<p>A black hole.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Troy, you could be an astronomer.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, there's only one black hole worth studying.</p>
<p>It's called Sagittarius A.</p>
<p>It's located in the center of our galaxy and it has the density of 40 suns.</p>
<p>Just like my wiener.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>You said "wiener."</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>Pierce and Troy didn't get along at first but now they're bonding through mutual adolescence.</p>
<p>Shut up, fart head.</p>
<p>Will you shut up, poo-poo head? Hi, everybody.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Well, look at this group.</p>
<p>Having some kind of meeting and being so diverse.</p>
<p>There is just, boy, there is just one of every kind of you, isn't there? Well, we are missing a pipsqueak but we don't want one, so beat it.</p>
<p>Uh, Pierce, that's the dean.</p>
<p>You kidding? Sorry.</p>
<p>Just my luck.</p>
<p>It's all right.</p>
<p>Don't let me interrupt.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I just roll around campus like a little football.</p>
<p>I can't believe this.</p>
<p>Here I am in a random conversation about football, and I'm talking to Troy Barnes, star quarterback from Riverside High.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Troy, did you know Greendale has a football team? Did you know they had a football? Ah.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That's very funny.</p>
<p>Troy, I was so sorry to hear about your injury, but now that you have recovered, we would love for you to play for the Human Beings.</p>
<p>The team's name is the Human Beings? Yeah.</p>
<p>My idea.</p>
<p>It was the Greendale Grizzlies but I thought that, um, well, a lot of these students have been called animals their whole lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know what to do about the mascot.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I could help with that, Your Honor.</p>
<p>I have a wealth of experience in image management, icon development, and Y2K preparedness.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Well, aren't you found money.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Troy, all of your friends are lining up to turn Greendale around.</p>
<p>How about you? Troy isn't interested in football anymore.</p>
<p>Getting injured in that keg stand was the best thing that ever happened to him.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>

Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Bros before hos, Troy.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Listen, man, no offense, but I was the best and I finished on top.</p>
<p>I wouldn't play for this school with a 10-foot pole.</p>
<p>Dean, I'm sure Troy will sign up for football, if and when some accident damages the part of his brain that feels pride.</p>
<p>Until then, would you excuse us? All right.</p>
<p>Well, uh, if you change your mind, the field is always open.</p>
<p>Oh, figuratively speaking.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Wednesdays and Sundays it's used as parking overflow for the megachurch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Now let's meet the minimum requirements for a language credit, shall we? Yes, but I need to go to the bathroom first.</p>
<p>Uh, Britta? Oh, no, I don't have to go.</p>
<p>I'll go with you.</p>
<p>What? She's offended? Girls go in groups.</p>
<p>Did you learn nothing from standup comedy in the '90s? I'm familiar with the concept, I just, uh, fine.</p>
<p>If it's important to Shirley, I'll go next time.</p>
<p>I'm willing to try some more mainstream feminine stuff.</p>
<p>Then you should know nothing says, "I'm a woman" like doing it with me.</p>
<p>Nothing says, "I'm a pig," like you.</p>
<p>Will they or won't they? Sexual tension.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>It makes the group uncomfortable when you talk like we're characters in a show you're watching.</p>
<p>Well, that's sort of my gimmick.</p>
<p>But we did lean on that pretty hard last week.</p>
<p>I can lay low for an episode.</p>
<p>Are you sure you made the right call on the football team, Troy? It looks like they won something once.</p>
<p>"Most Valued Customer, Henderson Trophy Cases."</p>
<p>We should still study a little more astronomy later, right? Maybe over some Milky Ways or some Mars bars.</p>
<p>Or pancakes.</p>
<p>"I'm Jeff and I'm a student at Greendale"? Well, that's not good.</p>
<p>Wood undergoes rapid oxidation because it reacts spontaneously to--</p>
<p>Okay, guys.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>We've talked about this.</p>
<p>Okay, you have got to turn off your cell ph--</p>
<p>That's mine.</p>
<p>My bad.</p>
<p>I'm going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Would you like to come with me? Well, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I would.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Okay, what's it called? Antoni? Hold on.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a pen? A pen? No one has a pen.</p>
<p>Why would you not bring a pen to class? Idiot.</p>
<p>No, you're not an idiot.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>I had my blinker on about five minutes and this no-good, "clearly bald but trying to hide it with a bandana" loser swooped right in.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>Maybe he didn't see you.</p>
<p>He saw me.</p>
<p>Maybe he had his blinker on too.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>So you got any family, Britta? Yeah.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>My mom might visit this weekend.</p>
<p>She and I are gonna get makeovers at that spa--</p>
<p>Makeovers.</p>
<p>They sure have us programmed right.</p>
<p>I am a female pleasure unit.</p>
<p>I require a new coat of paint.</p>
<p>Just something I thought might be fun.</p>
<p>Here's something I think might be fun.</p>
<p>Let's find out the number of makeup companies that are owned by women.</p>
<p>I'll save you the trouble.</p>
<p>It's zero.</p>
<p>Of course, you're saying, "Britta, aren't you a hypocrite? You're plastered with glitter and goo from head to toe like the rest of us."</p>
<p>Well, I also pay income tax and pull over for cops.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean I support a country that oppresses citizens, restricts voting rights.</p>
<p>Thanks for offering to help design the new mascot.</p>
<p>I, uh, have been a little stumped.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>That's no problem.</p>
<p>By the way, I took the liberty of thumbnailing a Human Being prototype, uh, which I modeled after Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You're offering it but… The penis is a little small, I think.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>It looks a lot like you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, here's the thing.</p>
<p>If we are the Human Beings, you know, and we have a mascot that's just a white guy, what message are we sending? Our symbol needs to reflect the diversity of our school and our species.</p>
<p>So, black? No, because we're not the Greendale Blacks, Mr. Hawthorne, or the Greendale Asians, or any other creed.</p>
<p>We are the Greendale Human Beings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry to disturb you guys.</p>
<p>Who are clearly looking at a clearly naked drawing of Pierce doing jumping jacks.</p>
<p>Dean, a quick download, please? Uh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fill me in later.</p>
<p>Whoa-oh.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Good, a pencil.</p>
<p>First of all, I'm flattered.</p>
<p>Oh, well, you're a very photogenic man.</p>
<p>Is that real bed head, or do you put something in there? Can I? Oh.</p>
<p>It's crispy.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the four disembodied heads and I thought, where's the heart? Where's the soul? Where's the different poster design? You know I did think those were less than personable.</p>
<p>Which is why I went with the full bodies in these mailers we have going out.</p>
<p>Ta-ta-ta.</p>
<p>Mailers? I didn't give permission for this.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, did you not read the release agreement on the back of your registration form? Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see why someone used to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Look, if someone from the outside were to find--okay, if someone from the outside were to find out that I am a student at a community college, that could have a negative impact on my future career.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Goodness.</p>
<p>Look what we have stumbled onto.</p>
<p>An opportunity to help each other out.</p>
<p>I suppose I wouldn't need this promotional campaign if I could announce to the press that Troy Barnes is playing football here.</p>
<p>I think he's been pretty clear about declining that offer.</p>
<p>I think if you said jump, he'd say, "How high?" If you said stop, he'd say "Hammer time." </p>
<p>You starting to get what I mean? Hmm? No, I need another example.</p>
<p>You know, I didn't realize before, but we should send those out to local businesses.</p>
<p>Law firms, lawyer companies, legal gatherings.</p>
<p>You trying to blackmail me? I think so.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I present to you the Greendale Human Being.</p>
<p>That's a falcon with a gun.</p>
<p>Now it's a falcon with an erection.</p>
<p>Oh, hi, Abed.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>He's just laying low.</p>
<p>Oh, are you going to the bathroom? Uh, yes.</p>
<p>I'll go with you.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm good.</p>
<p>She probably just, you know, had to go number two.</p>
<p>Okay, what's the closest planet to Earth? Planet Hollywood? Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>That's not the right answer but it shows how fun astronomy can be.</p>
<p>Hey, Troy, can I talk to you for a sec? We're studying, so Troy's busy.</p>
<p>Well, the galaxy's not going anywhere.</p>
<p>I'll bring him back.</p>
<p>You ever miss being a quarterback, Troy? I miss being the best at something.</p>
<p>I miss having a coach.</p>
<p>I miss knowing what to think.</p>
<p>You still know what to think, Troy.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>For instance, after the dean talked to you about football, you and I were thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>That dude looks like <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Moby</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005240">Moby</a></span><span class="years">1965&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">soundtrack</span><span class="tag prof">composer</span><span class="tag prof">music_department</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194173">tt1194173</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120053">tt0120053</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405336">tt0405336</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458175">tt1458175</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>We were thinking, what if Troy did play for Greendale? You'd be surprised at how many of your favorite football players got started at community college.</p>
<p>Really? Name one.</p>
<p>Who's your favorite player? Me.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Maybe you and I should go check out the Greendale Thunderdome.</p>
<p>The dome arrives later.</p>
<p>It comes with thunder.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little secret about me, Troy.</p>
<p>Every day, on my way to school, I drive through downtown, past the courthouse, just to get a glimpse of the world that I once ruled.</p>
<p>And I just wanna jump out of my car, run up the steps, and exploit the legal system for profit.</p>
<p>But I can't.</p>
<p>I'm locked out of my old kingdom.</p>
<p>You're not.</p>
<p>You see what I'm saying? You're saying I could be a lawyer.</p>
<p>I'm saying you're a football player.</p>
<p>It's in your blood.</p>
<p>That's racist.</p>
<p>Your soul.</p>
<p>That's racist.</p>
<p>Your eyes? That's gay? That's homophobic.</p>
<p>That's black.</p>
<p>That's racist.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>When you played, you were a god.</p>
<p>Now you're not playing and you're not.</p>
<p>I'd tell you to do the math, but math isn't important.</p>
<p>The only thing that's important is this.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Annie said--</p>
<p>Annie said that <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Benjamin Button</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421715">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">2008&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Drama</span><span class="tag genre">Fantasy</span><span class="tag genre">Romance</span></span></span></span> was compelling.</p>
<p>Look, she's a smart girl but sometimes she's just wrong.</p>
<p>Eighty-five, go long.</p>
<p>It's like a drug, isn't it? Feel it, Troy.</p>
<p>Throw it.</p>
<p>The scoreboard lights up.</p>
<p>There will be a scoreboard there.</p>
<p>It's complete.</p>
<p>Nice catch.</p>
<p>The girls, the glory, the scouts, the career.</p>
<p>It starts when you join this team.</p>
<p>Is that linebacker a pregnant woman? Look, you can meet them later, but this decision has to be yours, T-Bone.</p>
<p>And this decision has to be yes.</p>
<p>How did you know my nickname was T-Bone? Because you're a football player and your name begins with T.</p>
<p>Your name begins with T.</p>
<p>Britta? Oh, are you finished? I mean, I have to go, but apparently, I failed yesterday's tryouts for the position of bathroom companion.</p>
<p>Oh, Britta, I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>You didn't hurt my feelings, Shirley.</p>
<p>I don't need to go to the bathroom with other people.</p>
<p>I was just trying to throw you a bone because I like you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You can keep that bone.</p>
<p>Listening to a story about a stranger pissing me off and taking the stranger's side? And then you can't talk about your own business but you insinuate my mama's a robot because she and I want makeovers.</p>
<p>That is the ladies room, Britta.</p>
<p>A place where ladies go to share, listen, support each other, and discretely eliminate waste.</p>
<p>And I like you too.</p>
<p>I even like that you're a little hard, but if you can't learn to be soft in there, you need to pee alone.</p>
<p>I've peed alone my whole life.</p>
<p>Women have always hated me.</p>
<p>I don't even know how it started.</p>
<p>Maybe it was when I got boobs before everybody--</p>
<p>Shhh.</p>
<p>Not out here.</p>
<p>In there.</p>
<p>Whoo! Ha-ha.</p>

<p>So Troy is gonna play football.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which means I'll be getting rid of these.</p>
<p>No, uh, I won't mail these out but they are staying with me until the press announces that Troy is a part of the team.</p>
<p>And I want him at that pep rally tonight.</p>
<p>Reporters are gonna be there.</p>

<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Aha! I've been following you.</p>
<p>How much did the dean pay you to make Troy play football? I'm not having a conversation with someone who emerges from a bush.</p>
<p>Because I'm right? No.</p>
<p>Because I'm not in a commercial for breakfast cereal.</p>
<p>Look, the dean has pictures of me, okay? Horrible pictures of me.</p>
<p>Attending his school.</p>
<p>And for that, you've convinced Troy to flush his life down football's toilet again? Britta's right.</p>
<p>You are the most selfish person alive.</p>
<p>And all that is gonna end right now.</p>
<p>I'm telling him what kind of friend you really are.</p>
<p>Maybe you should tell him you're hopelessly in love with him.</p>
<p>High school must have been tough, huh? Waiting for a superstar to notice you.</p>
<p>But here, here, he's all alone and he needs so much help.</p>
<p>Did you enroll in all his classes or were you worried that might freak him out? The important thing is that you are there for him.</p>
<p>The important thing is that you are the only one there for him.</p>
<p>And you don't really care what he wants, just as long as you don't have to share him with the world.</p>
<p>Because, really, you are just as selfish as I am.</p>
<p>You're just not as good at it yet.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I could never be as good as you.</p>
<p>Probably because I actually care.</p>
<p>Profound but technically meaningless.</p>
<p>And don't bother trying that thing women do where they walk away and make the guy feel like crap, because it won't happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Shirley, will you please come to the bathroom with me? Where's Shirley? Shirley's not coming.</p>
<p>But, uh, I'm here to listen, girl.</p>
<p>Why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves for men? I don't know, sweetie.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because men make the world go around? Kleenex? I've been infatuated with Troy.</p>
<p>Now he's joining football.</p>
<p>Now he'll have his pick of the litter and I'll never get to be with him.</p>
<p>Oh, Annie, screw him.</p>
<p>There are guys out there that would kill to be with you.</p>
<p>If Troy isn't one of them, that's him failing your standards.</p>
<p>You got that? You're right.</p>
<p>I can't control him.</p>
<p>And if I truly cared about him, I wouldn't want to.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me, Britta.</p>
<p>It really helped.</p>
<p>Seriously? Yes.</p>
<p>Who's my girl? Excuse me.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Yes, you did.</p>
<p>Human Beings, Human Beings, Human Beings.</p>
<p>Human Beings, Human Beings.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Don't go in there, man.</p>
<p>What? You got the most you were ever going to get out of football in high school.</p>
<p>A life of disillusionment and depression begins on the other side of that door.</p>
<p>Hey, man, is this your first pep rally or something? You told me football was the most important thing in the world.</p>
<p>Well, buckle up, Troy. I was exaggerating.</p>
<p>It's kind of my gimmick.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>No, let me tell you something.</p>
<p>You know that keg flip that cost me my scholarship? Yeah.</p>
<p>I hurt myself on purpose.</p>
<p>What? There was a scout coming to the final game at Riverside and I couldn't take the pressure.</p>
<p>So I took the easy way out.</p>
<p>When you showed me that field, I saw there was nothing to worry about here.</p>
<p>I could just play football for the fun of it.</p>
<p>I mean, have you seen these guys? There is nowhere to go but up.</p>
<p>Dude, we have feelings.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I know I ended up here because things weren't that great out there.</p>
<p>You should try accepting where you're at, man.</p>
<p>Take a pottery class or something.</p>
<p># Greendale, we're number one #</p>
<p># Nancy Pelosi is no fun #</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I've decided to support Troy.</p>
<p>They deploy things in football.</p>
<p>I went for rhyme over clarity.</p>
<p>Look, I'm, uh, I'm really sorry about before.</p>
<p>I just think we were both wrong.</p>
<p>Really? Because I'm an 18-year-old girl and you made me cry in public.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe I was a little more wrong.</p>
<p>I should grow up and make peace with being here.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not like Greendale is gonna kill me or anything.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Oh! Sorry.</p>
<p>Hey, say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot, the Greendale Human Being.</p>
<p>The costume makes it difficult for him to see.</p>
<p>He can't move his mouth either.</p>
<p>But take it from me, that's human for "hello."</p>
<p>Let's get you into the pep rally.</p>
<p>Great idea.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>We've solved racism.</p>
<p>What's next? Let's do something for little people.</p>
<p>Or albinos.</p>
<p>How about little albinos? Well, this has the potential to be a uniquely Greendale experience.</p>
<p>My lady? My lord.</p>
<p>Attention, students, this is Abed.</p>
<p>And the disco spider.</p>
<p>Here at Greendale.</p>
<p>Greendale.</p>
<p>Say what? A few quick announcements.</p>
<p>Announcement number one.</p>
<p>All announcements will be cool, starting right now.</p>
<p>Announcement number two, butt soup.</p>
<p>Announcement number three, I am not Hadji from <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Jonny Quest</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206500">Jonny Quest</a></span><span class="titleType">tvSeries</span><span class="years">1986&ndash;1987</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Action</span><span class="tag genre">Adventure</span><span class="tag genre">Animation</span></span></span></span>, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>On security news, you guys gotta start locking the dean's door so guys like us don't get in.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
