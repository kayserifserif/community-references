<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Welcome back.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>What did you do over break? Oh, it's so awesome.</p>
<p>Me and Abed played this video game.</p>
<p>It's so dope.</p>
<p>It's a whole city.</p>
<p>You can drive anywhere.</p>
<p>You can rent an apartment.</p>
<p>Do taxes.</p>
<p>But don't get audited.</p>
<p>Because that's bad.</p>
<p>You could even enroll in community college.</p>
<p>Right now, it sounds as boring as real life, but it is not.</p>
<p>Vacations are wasted on the young.</p>
<p>You guys gotta get out there and see the world at some point or you're gonna miss your entire lives.</p>
<p>Where did you go, Britta? Amsterdam, I think.</p>
<p>I'll know more when I find my camera.</p>
<p>Guess what happened to me.</p>
<p>Oh, Pierce, you became a grandfather? No, I became even cooler.</p>
<p>These ironic T-shirts are all the rage.</p>
<p>Let's get one thing straight.</p>
<p>I wish I was still a lawyer, I'm only here because I'm hot for Britta, and I don't want to be anybody's friend.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.</p>
<p>You know, I gotta say, I, I took a look back at the guy I was last semester, and I realized, that guy was a drag.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Good to hear you admit it, Jeff.</p>
<p>No, the truth is, this is a new semester, a new Jeff.</p>
<p>Greendale is where I am and I am gonna make the best of it.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>You're like Hawkeye on <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>M*A*S*H</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098'>M*A*S*H</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1972&ndash;1983</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>War</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>He kept his upbeat humor and charm, even in the 11th year of the Korean War.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, don't go changing too much, Jeff.</p>
<p>I think we all like you just the way you were.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate that, but --</p>
<p>Did you just teleport here? No, I snuck in during the group hug.</p>
<p>You guys don't remember me? Buddy, from Spanish class.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's Buddy from Spanish class.</p>
<p>I've never seen you before in my life.</p>
<p>I don't know you.</p>
<p>I've seen Buddy before.</p>
<p>He sits in the corner, next to the dead plant.</p>
<p>Thank you, Abed.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have a tendency to melt into the background.</p>
<p>It's just my body type, but I definitely know you guys.</p>
<p>From watching you all last semester grow together.</p>
<p>F.</p>
<p>F minus.</p>
<p>Did you say S? He said F.</p>
<p>Who cheated? I did it.</p>
<p>Britta cheated? But why? Give me back my bra, Annie.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>I'm not even wearing a bra.</p>
<p>Ugh! Ugh! I don't even care who wins.</p>
<p>What? I sleep a lot in class, that one might have been a dream.</p>
<p>Well, Buddy, as you know, we haven't had Spanish class yet, so this meeting was more just for catching up between friends.</p>
<p>I heard that.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Well, maybe, so, I, heh.</p>
<p>Sorry, Britta.</p>
<p>I'll go first.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm sure you guys have a natural rapport and timing, and you know you're scared that adding a new member might throw everything off of its natural rhythm, but I feel like I know you guys already.</p>
<p>So you know, let me in, just tell me the rules, and I will follow.</p>
<p>Well, you already broke the only rule I have.</p>
<p>The rule about worrying about rules.</p>
<p>That's what I'm saying too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p># Spanish studying is better #</p>
<p># When you're Buddy-ing around yeah #</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Um, I received a text message about free Sephora samples? Ha-ha.</p>
<p>It was me.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Sorry about the ruse, but I have something better than exfoliating soap to rub on you.</p>
<p>An opportunity.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>As you can see, I am resurrecting the Greendale Gazette Journal Mirror.</p>
<p>And we need a student editor.</p>
<p>Someone with a real world savvy that extends beyond how to huff the ink.</p>
<p>Actually, dean, I'm resolved to spend this semester being more This would be your office.</p>
<p>Relaxed and awesome.</p>
<p>This is the first desk I've seen in six months that doesn't have "<span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Zeppelin</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496389'>Led Zeppelin</a></span><span class='years'>&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>music_department</span><span class='tag prof'>composer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075244'>tt0075244</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400016'>tt0400016</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013'>tt1483013</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632'>tt3501632</a></span></span></span></span> Rules" carved into it.</p>
<p>And you get an English credit.</p>
<p>Well, that ain't bad neither.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Guys, meet your new editor.</p>
<p>Mr. Winger is very excited to help you bring a voice back to the campus.</p>
<p>Jeff, I need to take your picture.</p>
<p>Good, we got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You guys knock yourselves out.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard, Jeff.</p>
<p>This is my article on the school's new water heater.</p>
<p>You've got chops, kid.</p>
<p>But we need your talent on a bigger story.</p>
<p>Pizza wars.</p>
<p>Who's got the best slice in town? Start with Big Nick's.</p>
<p>Bring us a large with sausage.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>I heard a rumor that Riley's Liquor is selling to underage students.</p>
<p>So I need an undercover exposé.</p>
<p>Find out how much they'll sell you of anything cold and imported.</p>
<p>You expect me to watch you do that without telling on you? That's a hard-hitting question, Annie.</p>
<p>Are you a reporter? No.</p>
<p>They've got me editing the crossword because I'm a girl.</p>
<p>And because I love crosswords.</p>
<p>Well, now you love the streets.</p>
<p>You're my ace newshound.</p>
<p>Ace? You can do that? We can do anything we want.</p>
<p>It's Greendale.</p>
<p>Now go find me that story.</p>
<p>This character reboot is really gelling for you, Jeff.</p>
<p>That was all classic <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hawkeye</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098'>M*A*S*H</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1972&ndash;1983</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>War</span></span></span></span>.</p>

When you've earned it.</p>
<p>Now, I know the news of Señor Chang's death over winter break was a shock to us all.</p>
<p>But we should take comfort in the fact that he did not suffer when his moped hit the side of that Arby's.</p>
<p>So sad.</p>
<p>But best semester ever.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Beat it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That was a professional actress.</p>
<p>I am a man who can never die, and this has been your first taste of Spanish 1-0-dos the semester I get inside your cabezas.</p>
<p># I am Señor Chang #</p>
<p># And I'm so ill #</p>
<p># This is a warning #</p>
<p># I can't be killed #</p>
<p># All in your cabeza #</p>
<p># Without a chaser #</p>
<p># Not another teacher #</p>
<p># With this much flavor, Chang #</p>
<p>Saw that coming.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>See you in study group.</p>
<p>Hoo-aah! Aah! Uh, Jeff, can he really just decide he's one of us? He throws off our balance.</p>
<p>We've got three chicks, three dudes, and now, two weirdoes.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Sorry, Abed.</p>
<p>Not all weirdoes are bad.</p>
<p>Buddy might be a puckish agent of change that changes our lives for the better through a musical montage.</p>
<p>Or he could have a row of jars waiting for our genitals.</p>
<p>Yo, I need my genitals.</p>
<p>You know who you guys sound like? Me, from last semester.</p>
<p>Cynical.</p>
<p>Elitist.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Rakishly good-looking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, we should at least get together to talk about membership policies, right? Hey, don't ask me.</p>
<p>Dealing with problems ain't my job no more.</p>
<p>My new job is hanging out, having fun and cracking wise.</p>
<p>Oh, must be nice.</p>
<p>Suppose I decide that's my job? Jeff.</p>
<p>I hope you've got an army of raisins, because I've got a major scoop.</p>
<p>In October, there was a free <span class='ref'><span class='reference people'>Toni Braxton</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004772'>Toni Braxton</a></span><span class='years'>1966&ndash;</span><span class='profs list'><span class='tag prof'>soundtrack</span><span class='tag prof'>actress</span><span class='tag prof'>producer</span></span><span class='knownFor list'><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246002'>tt0246002</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6626022'>tt6626022</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520498'>tt1520498</a></span><span class='tag knownFor'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278488'>tt0278488</a></span></span></span></span> concert on the quad You don't need to remind me.</p>
<p>And when a last-minute mix-up shifted the showtime by an hour, an anonymous text message went out alerting students of the change.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Not okay.</p>
<p>Because the text message was sent exclusively to black students.</p>
<p>And one French kid named Lebron.</p>
<p>That's profiling.</p>
<p>This is front page juice.</p>
<p>I gotta find out who sent the text.</p>
<p>Have you called the number that sent it? Well, nobody's that stupid, right? Hello? Um, wrong number.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That was a good cover.</p>
<p>So whoever it is keeps hanging up, but he can't hide forever.</p>
<p>Annie the reporter.</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>Listen up, I just want to say, thank you guys real much Real much? Duh.</p>
<p>Thank you guys very much for this.</p>
<p>It's a dream come true.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Now let's study some Spanish.</p>
<p>So for the essay, we conjugate Conjugate? Conjugal.</p>
<p>Visit.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Lame.</p>
<p>Okay, stick and move, stick and move.</p>
<p>Okay, so for the essay portion --</p>
<p># Annie got an essay portion #</p>
<p># Annie gonna move her luscious fanny all day long #</p>
<p>Hey, Buddy can sing, you guys.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>Well, that's great.</p>
<p>Annie's pretty young, we try not to sexualize her.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Whoa! Okay, look, I did You know what? It's your study group, and I don't know if you perceive it as something that could be improved but I do have some ideas.</p>
<p>Here's one right here.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>I was thinking, we could start saying, "You go, girl." </p>
<p>Not in a way that's, you know, oh, I'm so cool saying, "You go, girl." </p>
<p>But in a way that we're kind of winking at it.</p>
<p>Bottom line, you guys need a chubby, agile guy.</p>
<p>Did anyone see <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Paul Blart: Mall Cop</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1114740'>Paul Blart: Mall Cop</a></span><span class='titleType'>movie</span><span class='years'>2009&ndash;</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Action</span><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Crime</span></span></span></span>?</p>
<p>I'm like that, okay? I'm fat and I'm physical, okay? And I'm strong, hmm, and I can kick.</p>
<p>Oh! Dude, sorry.</p>
<p>Jeff, Jeff? No, no, it's fine.</p>
<p>Just a little, little nosebleed, I get them when it's dry, or when my face gets kicked.</p>
<p>I'll get some paper towels.</p>
<p>Did someone say something about a meeting to discuss member policy? I think it's obvious to everyone, that this Buddy fellow has a few fruit loops loose so I think no matter what we do, we gotta do it with grace and caution.</p>
<p>I say we keep Buddy in the group.</p>
<p>What? I've given it a lot of thought and frankly I like his in-your-face style.</p>
<p>I can't stop thinking about his high kick.</p>
<p>His ratio of girth to hip flexibility is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>I like his idea of ironically saying, "You go, girl." </p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>Wait, so you kick high enough and you get in the group? If we're gonna add people, I really think we should consider my friend Gary.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Shirley, you friend Gary is so boring.</p>
<p>He was raised in Finland, he doesn't get our humor.</p>
<p>So if we're gonna add a chair for every bong-ripping, good-time Charlie, with a song in his heart, I move we institute hazing.</p>

<p>I'm so bored of your pop culture references, and your cigarette-legged jeans.</p>
<p>Uh, Gary wears nothing but loose-fitting jeans.</p>
<p>Gary is off the table.</p>
<p>He is a buzz kill.</p>
<p>He grew up in a land without sun.</p>
<p>Take a vote.</p>
<p>They'd probably vote him in.</p>
<p>They won't.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>Guys, let's take a vote.</p>
<p>Secret vote, everybody cover your eyes.</p>
<p>We won't know the result.</p>
<p>Say your vote out loud.</p>
<p>We'll know each ether's voices.</p>

<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It says here, some guy in Seattle went nuts and killed his entire driver's ed class with a meat tenderizer.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>We have to be careful.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>On the count of three, everybody who wants to keep Buddy out, raise your hand.</p>
<p>You lied about the guy in Seattle with the meat tenderizer.</p>
<p>You put your thumb on the scale.</p>
<p>You did it with a smile and you did it so you could keep smiling.</p>

<p>Tell me, dean, when I refer to you in my article, would you prefer imbecile or incompetent? I'd prefer incompetent, but what I really want It doesn't matter what you want.</p>
<p>The people want the truth, I have to give it to them, and I won't let anyone stand in my way.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>I'm the least racist person in the world.</p>
<p>My best friend, when I was Okay, look.</p>
<p>I've learned my lesson.</p>
<p>I've got unlimited texting now.</p>
<p>But if she runs that story, I will lose this job, and this job is my life.</p>
<p>She listens to you.</p>
<p>Well, next time we're both hanging out, having fun, I could try cracking wise about it with her.</p>
<p>You do what you think is right.</p>
<p>That's enough.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm just saying, it's not exactly Watergate.</p>
<p>I mean, you like the dean, he's trying to help you transfer.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this time, he might succeed.</p>
<p>If this article breaks out, I can apply for journalism scholarships.</p>
<p>Nobody will care about my time in rehab if they think I'm a writer.</p>
<p>Annie, as your upbeat friend, I gotta say, let this go.</p>
<p>This is Greendale, Jeff, we can do whatever we want.</p>

<p># I'm so sorry #</p>
<p>Didn't anyone tell Buddy he was out? I guess we thought you would.</p>
<p>My lord, my lady, you missed my apology song.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll I'll tell them about it later.</p>
<p>Jeff, I am so sorry about the other day.</p>
<p>Buddy, yesterday, the group took a vote.</p>
<p>And you seem to have figured out the rest of it.</p>
<p>Was it the high kick? Was it, "You go, girl?" Oh, you guys think you're so cool.</p>
<p>No, we don't think we're cool at all.</p>
<p>Just a bit.</p>
<p>I put myself out there for you.</p>
<p>I laid my soul bare.</p>
<p>I made you guys lemon squares with free-range eggs that I baked with my own hands.</p>
<p>Maybe a little less sugar next time.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not leaving.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Be relaxed, like me.</p>
<p>Leave.</p>
<p>You're not relaxed.</p>
<p>You're an uptight puppet master.</p>
<p>And these are your little puppets.</p>
<p>I am no man's puppet, sir.</p>
<p>How dare you.</p>
<p>Buddy, just be reasonable and go.</p>
<p>Make me, Hitler.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, so, uh, so since Buddy's not leaving, he'll just be the person who we wish wasn't here while we study.</p>
<p>Try getting that deal from Hitler.</p>
<p>Shall we? I'm studying with you.</p>
<p>No, you're not.</p>
<p>Everyone stop studying.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You're not in the group.</p>
<p>Okay, then go study somewhere else.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, I wanna study with you guys.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>I hate your study group.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>You suck.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>And you are not running that story.</p>
<p>Why not? Because I said so.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a problem with how that was handled? It's okay.</p>
<p>Exactly the way I would've done it.</p>
<p>You suck.</p>
<p>Who are you kidding, Abed? I just dragged a screaming, crying man out of a library with his pants down.</p>

<p>If you had actually seen the show you'd know that <span class='ref'><span class='reference titles'>Hawkeye</span><span class='popup'><span class='label'><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098'>M*A*S*H</a></span><span class='titleType'>tvSeries</span><span class='years'>1972&ndash;1983</span><span class='genres list'><span class='tag genre'>Comedy</span><span class='tag genre'>Drama</span><span class='tag genre'>War</span></span></span></span> didn't just bed nurses and drink martinis.</p>
<p>He also had blood sprayed on his face and barked orders when the choppers came in.</p>
<p>If he didn't, people died.</p>
<p>He was a leader, Jeff.</p>
<p>That's your job.</p>
<p>Yeah? What's in it for me? Hey.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>I, I'm sorry that I yelled.</p>
<p>I'm glad you did.</p>
<p>It didn't even really occur to me what I was doing until I saw how upset you were.</p>
<p>I never want to be the reason you're mad, because you're Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>So thanks for getting mad.</p>
<p>It was nothing.</p>
<p>I guess that's the upside, isn't it?

<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>You made me so happy I just peed a little.</p>
<p>I don't think violence is the answer when we make decisions.</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p>Hi, Buddy.</p>
<p>Can you, um? Excuse us? For one crazy stalker? Listen up, we outnumber this guy six to one.</p>
<p>Annie, you flash your breasts as a decoy for the bumrush.</p>
<p>Pierce? Britta, don't be upset.</p>
<p>I didn't pick you as a decoy because your breasts are so old.</p>
<p>Why is he even here? Hello.</p>
<p>I invited him.</p>
<p>Buddy's crime is thinking we're cool.</p>
<p>But I get it.</p>
<p>I mean, if I were him, and I missed out on you guys, I'd be sitting in that classroom, watching, wondering.</p>
<p>So how can I exclude someone from something that I'm so lucky to have.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I say we let him in.</p>
<p>Hey, Buddy.</p>
<p>Welcome to the group.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>You will not regret this.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Hey, Buddy, the group thought about what you said.</p>
<p>We took a vote.</p>
<p>And you're in.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>I'm in the cool group? It's like Christmas morning for the guy.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>This is, oh, this is awkward.</p>
<p>You guys were my safety.</p>
<p>Pfft.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, Buddy, you don't have to worry about them.</p>
<p>You're with us now.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Ha-ha! Boo! It's amazing.</p>
<p>I love the kicks.</p>
<p>The kicks are the best.</p>
<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I voted to keep him.</p>
<p>Would have been nice to have another person in the group.</p>
<p>I'll call Gary.</p>
<p>So it says here you want to join as a twosome? I don't see that as a selling point.</p>
<p>We work really well together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me hear that rap thing of yours again.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm gonna talk it over with the others.</p>
<p>Cool, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>You traitors.</p>
<p>I am appalled at your lack of loyalty.</p>
<p>Yeah, you better run.</p>
<p>Have you decided? We saw your tape.</p>
<p>We're passing.</p>
<p>I don't pop on video.</p>
<p>Let me do the song in person.</p>
<p># Getting rid of Britta #</p>
<p># Getting rid of the B #</p>
<p># She's a GDB #</p>
<p># She's a no-good B #</p>
<p></p>
