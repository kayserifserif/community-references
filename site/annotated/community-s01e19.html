<p>I had to get up so early for my bus I caught what Cinemax gets up to at night.</p>

<p>Why are you taking the bus? What happened to your minivan? My ex-husband needed it.</p>
<p>The person he's dating works at a club an hour from the city.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, I'll play a violin for them and maybe she can strip to it.</p>
<p>Kind people are always kind, Britta.</p>
<p>Not just when it's easy.</p>
<p>As we stand, once again upon the deadline to drop or add classes, I hereby present this semester's Jeff Winger pick for ultimate blow-off class: Beginner Pottery.</p>
<p>Your last "blow off" class ended up teaching me to live in the moment.</p>
<p>Which I will always regret and never do again.</p>
<p>This one's different.</p>
<p>I researched.</p>
<p>You don't have to make a good pot.</p>
<p>You get an art credit for participation.</p>
<p>This class is like a redhead that drinks Scotch and loves <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Die Hard</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016">Die Hard</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1988&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Action</span><span class="tag genre">Thriller</span></span></span></span>.</p>

Sailing.</p>
<p>The nearest body of water is two and a half hours away.</p>
<p>Leagues, Abed.</p>
<p>We don't measure water by hours.</p>
<p>It's a one-week intensive that gives you hands-on experience on a real boat right here in the parking lot.</p>
<p>I'd rather learn boats than pots.</p>
<p>I was gonna take a class on how to put together an online dating profile.</p>
<p>But I think sailing in the parking lot is less pathetic.</p>
<p>A black person on a sail boat? I gotta see this.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>How about you, Abed? You wanna sail with us? There's black people.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hello, ladies.</p>
<p>What you guys making, big balls here? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You guys getting dirty? Nice.</p>
<p>What are you looking at? Heh, heh.</p>

<p>Ever since that movie was released in 1990, I have seen every conceivable variation of what I call ghosting.</p>
<p>This can be guy-on-girl, girl-on-guy.</p>
<p>The hilarious guy-on-guy.</p>

Let's have a great time.</p>
<p>I'm making falafel.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Not edible.</p>
<p>What are you making? A vase.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Yep? Look what I made.</p>
<p>A participant badge.</p>
<p>I don't know how.</p>
<p>I mean, I just stuck my hands into the clay and it happened.</p>
<p>You look at me.</p>
<p>You have a gift.</p>
<p>Jeff's competitive side had come out before, he had even displayed envy, but on that first day of Pottery class Abed.</p>
<p>Yeah? What did we discuss? No voiceover.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It is kind of a crutch.</p>
<p>I've never been on a boat before.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to wear.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's intimidating.</p>
<p>We're in Pierce's world now.</p>
<p>He's got all the boat clothes, and look at him christen.</p>
<p>If that were me, I would have broken the bottle.</p>
<p>I'm Professor Slaughter.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard the S.S. Nose Candy, purchased through government auction.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice.</p>
<p>It's not nice.</p>
<p>It's your only weapon against the raging sea.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to use her, you're dead.</p>
<p>Together, you will work as one crew.</p>
<p>You will succeed or fail as one crew.</p>
<p>You will consider this parking lot the ocean.</p>
<p>Whatever you drop, you lose.</p>
<p>Mishandle the sails, you capsize and die.</p>
<p>Now, does Little Miss Nice have a name? Shirley Bennett.</p>
<p>Well, now you're Captain Shirley Bennett.</p>
<p>Aw, man.</p>
<p>You will follow her every order.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I've never been a captain before.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>I commanded a jet ski through an electrical storm and only had one casualty.</p>
<p>Jet skis only hold two people.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Saved half the crew.</p>
<p>Pottery is much cooler than I thought.</p>
<p>And harder.</p>
<p>Well, except for that guy Rich.</p>
<p>He's like a natural.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm worried about the effect that it's having on Jeff, though.</p>
<p>Yeah, someone call a shrink.</p>
<p>What? Well, you're usually the cool one.</p>
<p>Abed, you understand the point of a blow-off class is to blow it off? Not to be cool at making really important mud pies.</p>
<p>Not willing to admit he's talented? No, because he's not.</p>
<p>If I ever make an effort in that class, you'd think I was the cat's pajamas.</p>
<p>"Cat's pajamas"? Okay, Pierce.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Somebody's mommy gave him too much praise.</p>
<p>Man, so did someone's psych teacher.</p>
<p>Oh, Señor Chang.</p>
<p>Yes, I was robbed at the YMCA.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>All right, let's do this.</p>
<p>Jeff, do you know what you are? You're special.</p>
<p>You're very special, Jeff.</p>
<p>You're the most special little boy in the world.</p>
<p>Take her back to harbor.</p>
<p>Flank the sheets and trim the headsail.</p>
<p>Eyes on me for a moment.</p>
<p>I don't see students here, I see seamen.</p>
<p>And I didn't create them.</p>
<p>From the moment you climbed aboard, I saw seamen inside you.</p>
<p>More importantly, you've stopped giggling at the word "seamen." </p>
<p>And that's the mark of a real seaman.</p>
<p>All right, as you were.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>Crew, make fast the topping lift.</p>
<p>I'll get the rope.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>He's ghost riding the jib.</p>
<p>Pierce, hang on.</p>
<p>That hat's gone.</p>
<p>Lost at sea.</p>
<p>I might be able to reach it.</p>
<p>It landed on that Hyundai.</p>
<p>I mean, mermaid's car.</p>
<p>Get back on this boat.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, I spoke too soon.</p>
<p>Everybody gets a D.</p>
<p>If I had chosen to hit you with a storm just then, you all would have failed.</p>
<p>You better get your crew in line, captain.</p>
<p>Permission to speak? Mm-hm.</p>
<p>You really screwed the pooch on that one, captain.</p>
<p>And I can't swim.</p>
<p>So, you see, ladies, it's actually a working fountain with a bird.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff, ready to make some art in the shape of a vase? No, can't.</p>
<p>Ooh, ouch.</p>
<p>Let me take a look.</p>
<p>Rich, being good at Beginner Pottery doesn't mean you can heal people.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>But my medical degree does.</p>
<p>I'm a doctor.</p>
<p>A doctor? I just take pottery to unwind.</p>
<p>I haven't lost a patient in five years.</p>
<p>Puts a lot of pressure on a person.</p>
<p>So the good news is this is neither sprained nor broken.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>But I'll have to get a second opinion from a guy in my basket-weaving class.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>Good to see you getting along with Rich.</p>
<p>What's he like? He's a ringer.</p>
<p>A what? You know, a con man, a grifter, a ringer.</p>
<p>He's an expert potter who signs up for novice classes to impress people.</p>
<p>If he wants to impress, why join a pottery class? Why not just say, "Hi, I'm a doctor"? Because he's crazy.</p>
<p>And fancy jobs don't impress people.</p>
<p>You weren't impressed I'm a lawyer.</p>
<p>Anyone can be a lawyer.</p>
<p>You can even represent yourself.</p>
<p>You can't do surgery on yourself.</p>
<p>It's illegal.</p>
<p>You'd get arrested.</p>
<p>And then you'd get a free lawyer.</p>
<p>Rich showed me how to make a flared lip on my pot and check for breast lumps.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>I don't know how, and I don't know when, but one day that guy is gonna slip up and when that happens, I am gonna be there to expose him.</p>
<p>Jeff, check it out.</p>
<p>If your finger's still bugging you, just get creative.</p>
<p>I wanna kiss you on the mouth.</p>
<p>I'm sorry? Hey, Rich.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Don't run so fast, you're among friends.</p>
<p>How you doing, Jeff? What's up? Not much, nada mucho.</p>
<p>Noddily Merchant.</p>
<p>Just want to thank you, Doc Potterywood, for taking a look at my finger.</p>
<p>Anytime.</p>
<p>Doc Potterywood, I like it.</p>
<p>Have you taken many pottery classes? No, this is my first.</p>
<p>Of the year? Ever.</p>
<p>No pottery at doctor school? Medical school? Pottery school.</p>
<p>Pottery school? Oh, pottery school? How long? Jeff, it's kind of weird, I feel I'm being interrogated, but by someone who doesn't really wanna know anything important.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Long way from home.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I did my residency in Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I give you a lift somewhere? Oh, no, thanks.</p>
<p>I'm getting there.</p>
<p>Did you sleep here? Only for a few hours.</p>
<p>Guess where Rich is from.</p>
<p>Couldn't have been Crazy Town.</p>
<p>You'd have gone to school together.</p>
<p>Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Nobody gets out of Santa Fe without learning to make a pot.</p>
<p>Forty-five percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>Fifth-highest Native American population.</p>
<p>They eat and breathe clay there.</p>
<p>I think some of this research may have been done on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You're mocking me? You? No, you, fine, go ahead, mock me.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff, you're <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Goldblum</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000156">Jeff Goldblum</a></span><span class="years">1952&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">actor</span><span class="tag prof">soundtrack</span><span class="tag prof">producer</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064">tt0091064</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290">tt0107290</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388">tt2278388</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629">tt0116629</a></span></span></span></span>-ing.</p>

Heh.</p>
<p>What? I, uh, I don't even know what that means.</p>
<p>Look, I have work to do before class because I wanna catch Rich when he slips up.</p>
<p>But who even cares if he's pretending to be a beginner? Pottery cares.</p>
<p>Integrity cares.</p>
<p>Look, I don't care.</p>
<p>I just care that he cares.</p>
<p>It's lame that he cares.</p>
<p>Shoelace came untied.</p>
<p>Could happen to anybody.</p>
<p>That's your excuse? Britta weighs 5 pounds.</p>
<p>Troy can't swim.</p>
<p>I've never seen the ocean.</p>
<p>Uh, I can swim, racist.</p>
<p>Listen to me.</p>
<p>On my boat, the crew comes first.</p>
<p>No single person is above it.</p>
<p>You either shape up or ship the hell out.</p>
<p>Now I know what the C in captain stands for.</p>
<p>Crab apple.</p>
<p>Shirley, I thought you said that kind people were always kind.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And strong people change.</p>
<p>If the sea was always still and calm, nobody would respect her.</p>
<p>I'm like the sea.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Cuckoo birds, do you mind? This is important.</p>
<p>College is where most mental problems activate.</p>
<p>I hope I get multiple personalities.</p>
<p>I get lonely in long showers.</p>
<p>The barometer's dropping.</p>
<p>The temperature is warm, but we're heading into a high-pressure flow.</p>
<p>That's a perfect storm.</p>
<p>Reef the mainsail and furl the jib.</p>
<p>Is that nautical talk or urban speak? We have to turn back.</p>
<p>Accidental jibe.</p>
<p>Hit the deck.</p>
<p>Oh! Man overboard.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Pierce is dead! No, wait.</p>
<p>His stomach is moving.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Pull me in.</p>
<p>The storm is overtaking you, captain.</p>
<p>We don't have time.</p>
<p>I'm trying as hard as I can.</p>
<p>I have skinny arms for a quarterback.</p>
<p>I said, we don't have time.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Pull Wait.</p>
<p>Pull me in.</p>
<p>What do you mean, "time"? That's it.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>No! Bring the boom amidship.</p>
<p>No! No! What in God's name have we done? Hey.</p>
<p>Get out of my parking spot, dipwad.</p>
<p>Security.</p>
<p>I mean, take an intermediate class if you're an intermediate.</p>
<p>Don't come in here making your fear of failure our problem.</p>
<p>I mean, it's crazy.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, he's a crazy person.</p>
<p>I'm scared.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>This is good for him.</p>
<p>He's confronting his own limitations.</p>
<p>Busted.</p>
<p>Fatal mistake, Richy boy.</p>
<p>You are busted.</p>
<p>I am? You just used the "throwing off the hump" method.</p>
<p>That's an advanced pottery technique, which I know because last night I read the entire Encyclopedia of Pottery.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? You are no beginner, Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Hey, what is going on, my blueberries? Show him what you did.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>
<p>What case? Throw the freaking hump, imposter.</p>
<p>What are you doing? No.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! It's the hilarious guy-on-guy.</p>
<p>One rule I asked you to follow.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Oh! I had it made before he died.</p>
<p>It's not in bad taste.</p>
<p>Out, Winger.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>No, that's fine.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>You've failed a class so easy that people passing in the hallway get a contact credit.</p>
<p>No, this is abuse! This is abuse! Pierce.</p>

Is this about that guy in your class? Yeah.</p>
<p>Face the facts.</p>
<p>This kid's got some natural talent you just don't have.</p>
<p>How would you know? It's all over the school.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Why aren't you in sailing class? They drowned me.</p>
<p>Why? For a better grade.</p>
<p>But weren't we discussing your flaws, Jeff? Why are you letting this guy get to you? What's really going on? I made a bad pot.</p>
<p>For some reason, I always thought that I was special and different.</p>
<p>And I guess I just have a really hard time when I want to be good at something and I suck.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Here, give me a hand.</p>
<p>What are you doing? I'm going back to my sailing class.</p>
<p>After they murdered you? Jeffrey, when I was born, I got my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck, both arms and one of my ankles.</p>
<p>Mom said there came a point when the doctors stopped delivering me and just started laughing.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>I mean, if I ever let being bad at something stop me, I wouldn't even be here.</p>
<p>That thing some men call failure? I call living.</p>
<p>Breakfast.</p>
<p>And I'm not leaving till I've cleaned out the buffet.</p>
<p>Now, how about a shove? Good luck, Pierce.</p>
<p>Don't need it.</p>
<p>Never had it.</p>
<p>Britta, trim the boom flat.</p>
<p>Troy, sit windward to heel the boat.</p>
<p>My, the sea has a worthy opponent.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, it's Pierce.</p>
<p>Man, that guy's life is one big joke.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel bad for him, but things have been running smoother since he drowned.</p>
<p>I bet he gets that all the time.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It's going down.</p>
<p>Pierce is going to be the only person ever to drown in a parking lot, twice.</p>
<p>Help! Damn the storm.</p>
<p>We're going after Pierce.</p>
<p>Jump the halyard.</p>
<p>Star-Burns, get down there and man the iron jinny.</p>
<p>There's a man overboard.</p>
<p>That's an order.</p>
<p>I'm gonna sink.</p>
<p>I'm about to get the only A I will ever get, and Pierce isn't even dying.</p>
<p>Bailing.</p>
<p>You don't have to do this.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But I'd rather be kind and get stepped on every once in a while than be a hard-ass and turn my back on a friend.</p>
<p>Hoist the mains.</p>
<p>I don't want to go this way.</p>
<p>We're coming, Pierce.</p>
<p>Help.</p>
<p>How's it looking? We've gotta go faster.</p>
<p>Okay, come on, Star-Burns.</p>
<p>It's filling with water.</p>
<p>It's going down.</p>
<p>Pierce, we're coming.</p>
<p>Dear God.</p>
<p>Dear God.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, Britta.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>We gotcha.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you okay? You all right? You just steered your boat into a storm.</p>
<p>Any last words? The sea may be cold and unforgiving, but I'm not.</p>
<p>The ship might go down but at least she'll go down with honor.</p>
<p>Then I'll take your captain's hat because I'm promoting you to admiral.</p>
<p>You all get an A.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Admiral Shirley.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Well, it means nothing, really, the class is over.</p>
<p>But you deserve it.</p>
<p>Hey, somebody has to do this.</p>
<p>I'm king of the Don't ruin a perfect week.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna spoon you again.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can't fully explain my behavior.</p>
<p>I'd love to blame booze or demon possession You know what? Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I'm bad at holding grudges.</p>
<p>Well, I'm bad at pottery.</p>
<p>I'm an amateur pottery enthusiast trying as hard as I can at something I suck at.</p>
<p>It's great.</p>
<p>And the teacher said I could stay if I don't have any more <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Ghost</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653">Ghost</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1990&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Drama</span><span class="tag genre">Fantasy</span><span class="tag genre">Romance</span></span></span></span> bursts.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Well, good luck.</p>
<p>Don't need it.</p>
<p>Jeff, you're a normal person.</p>
<p>There's nothing very special about you at all.</p>
<p>You're going to be great at a few things but really crappy at many more.</p>
<p>And that takes a lot of the pressure off so you can live a full, happy life.</p>
<p>Oh, and sorry it took me so long to tell you that and it was only in your imagination.</p>
<p>My bad.</p>
<p>Kind of a sloppy mom.</p>
<p>That's okay, Mom.</p>
<p>Nobody's perfect.</p>
<p>I'm still scared.</p>
<p>A clay ashtray.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Why do you have time to make pottery? Couldn't you use a little more practice being a doctor? Not that it'll ever bring your brother back to life.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be you on that roller coaster, Richard.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be you.</p>
<p>Whoo! Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Again? Good grief.</p>
<p></p>
