<p>So cellular mitosis is what? I miss Troy.</p>
<p>Wrong, and stop guessing that.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>I'm worried about Abed.</p>
<p>He hasn't left the apartment since Troy moved out.</p>
<p>He won't even play in the Dreamatorium.</p>
<p>Sorry, not "play."</p>
<p>"Render imaginated dreamscapes." </p>
<p>Guys, we just finished retaking biology all summer, and if I don't pass this final, it was for nothing.</p>
<p>Can we stay on target? Did someone say "sexy construction worker"? - Ooh! - Stay stay on target.</p>
<p>I'm dressed like this because I'm building to big news.</p>
<p>Subway has officially ended its agreement with Greendale, and the restaurant I've chosen to occupy the cafeteria kiosk is Shirley's Sandwiches! I just need one of you to sign this as the official owner of the business.</p>
<p>Ooh, we should both sign it, we're 50-50 partners.</p>
<p>But there's only one dotted line on the form, so - Oh, well, Pierce can - Me.</p>
<p>Hey! - I paid for it.</p>
<p>Well, there'd be no "it" to pay for if I hadn't done all the work.</p>
<p>My goodness, this molehill is becoming a mountain.</p>
<p>You guys work it out, while I put together an Alpine costume.</p>
<p>I knew eventually you'd try to box me out of my own business, just like Hawthorne Wipes did.</p>
<p>I'm not letting you guilt me into letting you call yourself the owner of my company.</p>
<p>Jeff! Hello? Get involved.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I am here to replace my fake bachelor's so I can get back to my life as a lawyer.</p>
<p>Nobody else is sacrificing their interests.</p>
<p>Don't ask me to sacrifice mine.</p>
<p>Don't ask me to sacrifice mine.</p>
<p>That's you just now.</p>
<p>Okay, so name the stages of mitosis.</p>
<p>Ooh, I gotta go.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Today is Abed's first therapy session.</p>
<p>His what? He's been feeling extra vulnerable lately having lost Troy to the air conditioning repair school, so he's finally gonna let me practice my psych skills on him.</p>
<p>Give me some credit, Winger.</p>
<p>What's the worst that could happen? Classic tee-up.</p>
<p>Shut up, Leonard, I know about your crooked wang.</p>
<p>No such thing as bad press.</p>
<p>Hey, Abed.</p>
<p>This can't be good.</p>
<p>There are those who ask, why connect the capillary tube directly to the compressor valve? Oh, sure, why not just attach it to the moisture accumulator? Hey, Troy.</p>
<p>We boring you? I miss my friends.</p>
<p>He misses his friends.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnes, gather your things and come with me.</p>
<p>Now! The sun chamber.</p>
<p>A shameful relic from a savage chapter of our history.</p>
<p>Repairmen would duel each other inside, losers succumbing to heat exhaustion, or worse.</p>
<p>Troy, there is a prophesy.</p>
<p>I miss Abed so much.</p>
<p>I'm ashamed to confess that I once thought that this might be me.</p>
<p>Now I realize that it's you.</p>
<p>You are the true repairman, Troy.</p>
<p>You fix not only air conditioners but the men who fix them.</p>
<p>It's a trade school.</p>
<p>It's a two-year degree in boxes that make rooms cold.</p>
<p>Sir, there's been a flow duct rupture in quadrant four.</p>
<p>I'll handle it.</p>
<p>This is your destiny, Mr. Barnes.</p>
<p>The true repairman will repair man.</p>
<p>Abed.</p>
<p>I'm not talking to you because I'm not crazy.</p>
<p>Think of it as inner dialogue.</p>
<p>I'm reading the novelization of Chronicles of Riddick.</p>
<p>Can you honestly tell me that's a saner decision? You're worried you'll go crazy without Troy.</p>
<p>That's why you're gonna let Britta fix you, right? Because you think you're broken, you're gonna get diagnosed by someone who said her favorite superhero was "x-man"? I'm a little scared.</p>
<p>Things are bad.</p>
<p>When the world gets bad enough, Abed, the good go crazy.</p>
<p>But the smart They go bad.</p>
<p>Come on in here, let's talk about it.</p>
<p>I think it's safer if I talk to Britta.</p>
<p>I think it's even safer if I talk to her first.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Are you here to help me with biology, or get me to help you? - Bi-ol-o-gy.</p>
<p>Are you lying? Hard to break the word "yes" into lilting syllables, huh? Ye-es? Look, Pierce and I are so close to getting the sandwich shop going.</p>
<p>I just need you to help Look.</p>
<p>You want one piece of free advice? Let Pierce cool down.</p>
<p>You know how crazy and paranoid he can get.</p>
<p>A-ha! Crazy? Paranoid? Impotent? - Cellular - I knew you'd run to Jeff, and turn him against me.</p>
<p>Mitosis.</p>
<p>Guys, why are we yelling? You sign that paper, I'll sue.</p>
<p>Well, hold on.</p>
<p>This will be settled in Greendale court, 3:00 P.M.</p>
<p>Obviously, Shirley has her counsel, and I get to dress like a judge.</p>
<p>I was born in a courtroom, sued it for my own placenta, and won.</p>
<p>Now I'm calling my lawyer.</p>
<p>My biology final is at 5:00.</p>
<p>I'm available from 3:00 to 4:00.</p>
<p>I'll see you in court.</p>
<p>Hello, Abed? Ready to get therapized? Abed? Hello, Britta.</p>
<p>Come in.</p>
<p>What's going on? Vice Dean Laybourne was repairing a flow duct rupture, and he inhaled a lethal dose of freon.</p>
<p>May his breeze join the wind.</p>
<p>Okay, so mitosis is when cells divide I wonder who Pierce is gonna get to represent him.</p>
<p>I promise, whoever Pierce brings won't be prepared for me.</p>
<p>That's the Winger guaran Is that the cold-blooded former colleague that got you fired from your old law firm by ratting on you to the state bar? Tee.</p>
<p>You know, Alan working at your former firm and all? Hey, Pierce just did you the biggest favor of your life.</p>
<p>He hired a guy I've spent the last two years fantasizing about stabbing in the Sundance! - Tango! - Hey.</p>
<p>So, the case of the sandwich signature.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? I mean, me, I have to, but you? Hawthorne's a cash cow, and old a-con here is tugging at that teat.</p>
<p>That's money.</p>
<p>Money.</p>
<p>Please stop that.</p>
<p>So full disclosure.</p>
<p>The firm would really like to keep vitamin "p" in its medicine chest.</p>
<p>Full disclosure.</p>
<p>I really want to be done by 4:00.</p>
<p>Oh, that's the Jeff wing basket I remember loving.</p>
<p>Hey, just go easy on Shirley.</p>
<p>Scout's honor, Sinead O'Connor.</p>
<p>Oy-yay, oy-yay, the honorable Craig Pelton presiding.</p>
<p>First off, there's one decision I'll need your help making.</p>

<p>So let's talk about evil.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe I should talk to Good Abed instead.</p>
<p>Where I come from, his name is Lame Abed.</p>
<p>And you come from - The darkest timeline.</p>
<p>You might call it the Britta of timelines, where everything is the worst.</p>
<p>Jeff has one arm there.</p>
<p>Annie shot Pierce.</p>
<p>Troy can't speak --</p>
<p>Ah! Now we're getting somewhere.</p>
<p>I think lame Abed sent you to talk because you're more equipped to deal with fear.</p>
<p>That's the lame way of seeing it, yes.</p>
<p>Here's the truth.</p>
<p>I've crossed into your dark timeline, and now I'm going to darken it.</p>
<p>How? Tell me about your parents, Britta.</p>
<p>Um, no? Barnes, you should be in the chapel.</p>
<p>We lost a great man today.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was the best, wasn't he? That's why I don't understand how he could rupture a freon line.</p>
<p>That's kind of a rookie mistake.</p>
<p>I'm sure it was just a faulty valve.</p>
<p>My first order as vice Dean, I'm gonna have them all replaced.</p>
<p>So you're vice Dean now? Why the sudden interest in air conditioning repair? I thought you missed your friends.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Then go be with them.</p>
<p>I'm releasing you.</p>
<p>But you - Goodbye, Troy.</p>
<p>Miss Edison, do you recognize the baby in that picture? That's Shirley's baby Ben.</p>
<p>Would you think less of Shirley Bennett if she offered to sell Ben on craigslist for a chance to bump it with Denzel? That was a joke for my cousin.</p>
<p>Damn those Facebook privacy settings.</p>
<p>Jeff, do something.</p>
<p>He's got nothing.</p>
<p>I'm sure she didn't mean that.</p>
<p>Or perhaps she doesn't even love that baby, because she spent most of last year not even knowing who the father is.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>Establishing character, your honor.</p>
<p>This woman is clearly unfit to own a sandwich shop.</p>
<p>Alan, come on.</p>
<p>No furths.</p>
<p>I thought you said you were gonna go easy.</p>
<p>Felt easy to me.</p>
<p>What was he wearing? He was dressed as a dinosaur.</p>
<p>Is that why you dropped out of High School? I don't know.</p>
<p>Are those even real glasses? No.</p>
<p>Ah, do you feel that, Britta? Your timeline's 10% darker now.</p>
<p>This was 10%? Do you know what kind of person becomes a psychologist, Britta? A person that wishes, deep down, that everyone more special than them was sick, because "healthy" sounds so much more exciting than "boring." </p>
<p>You're average, Britta Perry.</p>
<p>You're every kid on the playground that didn't get picked on.</p>
<p>You're a business casual potted plant, a human white sale.</p>
<p>You're VH1, Robocop 2, and Back to the Future 3.</p>
<p>You're the center slice of a square cheese pizza.</p>
<p>Actually, that sounds delicious.</p>
<p>I'm the center slice of a square cheese pizza.</p>
<p>You're Jim Belushi.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Whe<span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Jim Belushi</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000902">Jim Belushi</a></span><span class="years">1954&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">actor</span><span class="tag prof">music_department</span><span class="tag prof">producer</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117468">tt0117468</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095963">tt0095963</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091419">tt0091419</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562">tt0072562</a></span></span></span></span>going? To make this timeline the darkest of all.</p>
<p>Starting with your lame hero, Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>I don't suppose lame Abed owns a bone saw.</p>
<p>So, Pierce, you're seeking full ownership of Shirley's Sandwiches.</p>
<p>After all, you did provide Correct.</p>
<p>You really did? Oh, damn it.</p>
<p>Jeez, I came to this thing unprepared.</p>
<p>I mean, I -- I guess it's my job to somehow tarnish you in the eyes of the court, but, uh, let me check my notes.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, while I'm doing this, does anybody know any funny jokes? I do.</p>
<p>An Irish and a Jew walk into a Chinese laundry -- with a gay duck.</p>
<p>All right, okay! - Oh, right! So you're telling me they're not good at basketball? I have no questions, your honor.</p>
<p>Cruel.</p>
<p>Cruel, cruel, cruel.</p>
<p>In the name of the five winds East, West, North, the one we keep secret, and South, I hereby proclaim you --</p>
<p>This ceremony is a lie.</p>
<p>And having a special room for it is a waste of valuable floor space.</p>
<p>You are no longer a student here.</p>
<p>And we use this room for yoga on weekends.</p>
<p>Remove him.</p>
<p>I am the truest repairman.</p>
<p>And this man is a dishonor to making air conditioners work good.</p>
<p>And I have the right to challenge him -- in the sun chamber.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Your less than honor, can I call a recess? Ooh, yay, costume change.</p>
<p>Court briefly adjourned.</p>
<p>What are you trying to do, Winger? Zealously represent your client? Let me make things a little easier for you.</p>
<p>Figure out a way to throw this case, or figure out where you're gonna work when you get out of here, because I don't know where it's gonna be if it's not for us.</p>
<p>That's right, Jeff.</p>
<p>I went there.</p>
<p>You drove me there.</p>
<p>Miss Daisy's in the house, thanks for the ride, sorry about slavery.</p>
<p>Don't oversell your clout, Alan.</p>
<p>You're partner because I sold you to Ted.</p>
<p>Ted respects me Ted's gone.</p>
<p>He got too old, couldn't swim with the sharks, and got eaten.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>He started the firm.</p>
<p>You can't lose your own firm.</p>
<p>You can if you're dead.</p>
<p>That shark thing was not a metaphor.</p>
<p>I'm the big dog now.</p>
<p>So you want the last three years in this toilet to have a point? Then I'm the guy you got to make happy.</p>
<p>Or, you know, you could finish up your big win here.</p>
<p>Court is in session.</p>

Ahh! Oh, one more recess.</p>
<p>I hit the corner right on a fresh tattoo.</p>
<p>Well boys and girls I hope you brought your popsicles, because it's about to get scalding hot in the sun chamber.</p>
<p>You already know the rules Because there aren't any! Jeez, Dennis, are you on coke? Take that crap off and sit down.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Of course there are rules.</p>
<p>Two men are sealed in the chamber, each with a broken unit.</p>
<p>The heat will increase until one man yields or dies.</p>
<p>Begin! You're just in time for Jeff's closing statements.</p>
<p>Who cares? Everything is terrible.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Have you been watching Dance Moms again? I'm thinking of dyeing my hair.</p>
<p>Evil Abed, what are you doing? I'm going to cut off Jeff Winger's arm.</p>
<p>I won't let you.</p>
<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>Don't you mean dark? Welcome to my world.</p>
<p>Psst! Jeff! Winger! Jeffrey, this is a a terrible situation for me to have put you in.</p>
<p>A guy like Alan isn't above making trouble for you at your old firm.</p>
<p>Shirley, it's not worth your career.</p>
<p>I want you to have what you want.</p>
<p>Thank you, Shirley.</p>
<p>Settle down.</p>
<p>Okay, Jeffrey, let's have your closing statement.</p>
<p>Your honor I have no closing statement, because I'm throwing the case.</p>
<p>No, no, it's okay.</p>
<p>It's fine, don't worry.</p>
<p>My client, Shirley Bennett, my friend of three years, she told me that it was okay.</p>
<p>She said what I want was more important.</p>
<p>She's right, right? I mean, guys like me, we'll tell you there's no right or wrong.</p>
<p>There's no real truth.</p>
<p>I'll kill you.</p>
<p>I'll kill you just like I killed him.</p>
<p>And as long as we all believe that, guys like me can never lose.</p>
<p>Was that out loud? Because the truth is I'm lying when I say there is no truth.</p>
<p>The truth is the pathetically, stupidly, inconveniently obvious truth is Helping only ourselves is bad, and helping each other is good.</p>
<p>Now I just wanted to get out of here, pass biology, and be a lawyer again instead of helping Shirley.</p>
<p>That was bad.</p>
<p>And my former colleague wanted so badly to keep his rich client that he just asked me to roll over in exchange for my old job.</p>
<p>So I guess we all walked in here pretty bad.</p>
<p>But now Shirley's gone good.</p>
<p>Shirley's helping me.</p>
<p>It's that easy.</p>
<p>You just stop thinking about what's good for you, and start thinking about what's good for someone else.</p>
<p>And you can change the whole game with one move.</p>
<p>Now if you like this idea, you can make it true by doing something good for everyone here.</p>
<p>Throw this case out of court.</p>
<p>It's dumb.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>I withdraw my case.</p>
<p>Why didn't you just do some inspirational speech about friendship? You're fired.</p>
<p>Way to go, soft serve.</p>
<p>You're finished.</p>
<p>By the way, never got a chance to tell you this, but it was me who turned you in to the state bar.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And I never got a chance to thank you.</p>
<p>This place has made you so gay.</p>
<p>Hey! Don't use "gay" as a derogatory term.</p>
<p>Booyah, good person.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, take this man to the infinite labyrinth of eternal ice.</p>
<p>Yes! - No! No, take him to the police.</p>
<p>He murdered someone.</p>
<p>Take him to jail.</p>
<p>You guys are weird.</p>
<p>Jeff, that was great.</p>
<p>You were like a white Blair Underwood.</p>
<p>Shirley, if<span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Blair Underwood</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005516">Blair Underwood</a></span><span class="years">1964&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">actor</span><span class="tag prof">producer</span><span class="tag prof">director</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160797">tt0160797</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177">tt0119177</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113501">tt0113501</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120647">tt0120647</a></span></span></span></span>, I think we should let Jeff sign the sandwich shop form.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could represent both of us.</p>
<p>You know, like our attorney.</p>
<p>My God, Pierce! You had your first good idea.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Britta, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, Abed.</p>
<p>I should've never played therapist with you.</p>
<p>I'll change my major just one more time.</p>
<p>But you can't.</p>
<p>You cured me.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not cured.</p>
<p>I'm willing to admit I definitely need therapy.</p>
<p>You're the only kind of shrink I could ever trust.</p>
<p>The kind with as little control over my mind as me.</p>
<p>Mind if I cut in? Troy! You're back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I made a new rule that the air conditioning repair school has to act like a regular school.</p>
<p>I can do that because I'm their messiah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I went crazy and I wanted to cut off Jeff's arm.</p>
<p>I missed you so much, buddy.</p>
<p>So, Jeff, we still best friends? All right.</p>
<p>Cellular mitosis.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>

<p>That one's shaped like a duck.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that's definitely a buy.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Let's Potato Chips are good, and they're a buy.</p>
