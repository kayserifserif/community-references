<p>Gather close that you might hearken the story of Fat Neil.</p>
<p>Born stout of heart but large of bone, his adolescent years were shadowed by scorn and mockery.</p>
<p>Hey, fatty, fatty.</p>
<p>Hey, fatty, fatty.</p>
<p>Outlets of fantasy afforded him some escape from the darkness throughout high school.</p>
<p>And as a man, he traveled far, to a new school and a new beginning.</p>
<p>Or so he thought.</p>
<p>They're down there by Fat Neil.</p>
<p>It's Fat Neil.</p>
<p>It's Fat Neil.</p>
<p>The name became a joke.</p>
<p>I'll have what Fat Neil's having.</p>
<p>The joke became his life.</p>
<p>Yes, Fat Neil? And Neil fell again into darkness.</p>
<p>Only this time, his thoughts turned to an escape of which we dare not speak.</p>
<p>But pain need not be spoken to be known.</p>
<p>Not to all.</p>
<p>It was, strangely, Jeff the Liar, son of William the Barely Known, who first became concerned.</p>
<p>Neil.</p>
<p>It was Jeff who pretended to be interested in Dungeons & Dragons in an effort to lift Neil's spirits.</p>
<p>And when Jeff's fake interest resulted in Neil giving Jeff all his books, explaining he wouldn't need them anymore, it was Annie the Dayplanner, herself a recovering headcase, that recognized the signs of coming doom.</p>
<p>A council was called.</p>
<p>Troy the Obtuse.</p>
<p>Shirley the Cloying.</p>
<p>Hee-hee-hee.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Abed the Undiagnosable.</p>
<p>Assange is a modern-day Paine.</p>
<p>Britta the Needlessly Defiant.</p>
<p>For reasons that should be obvious, Pierce the Insensitive, known also as Pierce the Dickish, and Grandpa the Flatulent, was not invited.</p>
<p>The group agreed that what Fat Neil needed most was to feel like a winner for a change.</p>
<p>They would invite Neil that Saturday to a game of Dungeons & Dragons designed by Abed to help Neil reclaim his confidence.</p>
<p>For Neil.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, they realized that Chang had been there and felt too awkward to mention it.</p>
<p>What they couldn't have known was that they had just scheduled the most important game of Dungeons & Dragons ever.</p>
<p>A game which not only might save a life, but which would forever change the balance between good and Pierce.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hey, Neil.</p>
<p>This is gonna be awesome, yo.</p>
<p>We're gonna ignore that hate crime? I'm a dark elf or a drow.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be wearing armor? Ha, ha.</p>
<p>I'm an elf, not a nerd.</p>
<p>You guys suddenly wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons? Yeah.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't we?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's cool.</p>
<p>And when you play it, it makes you happy, like a dragon.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hi, I am your Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>We will be playing this adventure, The Cavern of Draconis.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Neil has a character named Duquesne that he's been playing for years so I made these for you guys.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Choose carefully.</p>
<p>They each have unique combinations of strengths and --</p>
<p>Alrighty.</p>
<p>Shouldn't there be a board or pieces or something to Jenga? No, this is a role-playing game.</p>
<p>It takes place in our imagination.</p>
<p>Oh, Neil.</p>
<p>I tell a story and you make choices in the story.</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<p>You're all standing on a country road.</p>
<p>The evil dragon Draconis dwells nearby guarding a massive pile of treasure.</p>
<p>Working as a team, your goal is to track down the dragon, kill him and claim the treasure as your own.</p>
<p>Jeff, your turn.</p>
<p>It's my turn? Oh.</p>
<p>Um, what do I do, roll dice? You tell me what you want to do.</p>
<p>Then I roll to see if you're successful.</p>
<p>What are my choices? You're slowing things down.</p>
<p>Shirley? I'd like to introduce myself to the group.</p>
<p>Hello, I am a dwarf named Zibbady Doo.</p>
<p>I'm not the best at making up names.</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>I'm "Mar." </p>
<p>Boy, you weren't kidding.</p>
<p>Hello, Mar.</p>
<p>My name is Bing Bong the Archer.</p>
<p>I'm an archer and such.</p>
<p>I'm Ew.</p>
<p>"Hector the Well-Endowed"? Abed.</p>
<p>I didn't know you'd grab one at random.</p>
<p>I made that one with Troy in mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bet you did.</p>
<p>Okay, hi, I'm "Lavernica." </p>
<p>I have three armors, boots, belt, a torch Wait, let her finish.</p>
<p>Worst introduction ever.</p>
<p>Check it.</p>
<p>I am Brutalitops the Magician.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Magic user, baby.</p>
<p>What? An arrow flies through the air, almost hitting Brutalitops.</p>
<p>Six goblins are running toward you, drawing daggers.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I attack them using my additional notes.</p>
<p>It has no effect.</p>
<p>Britta? Why are these goblins attacking us? Maybe these woods are their rightful land and from their perspective You're the AT&T of people.</p>
<p>You've been shot by an arrow.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it hurts.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Uh, I take my throwing knife and throw it, knife style.</p>
<p>You do 10 points of damage.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>What am I not good at? Sex.</p>
<p>But the goblins close in, surrounding you on all sides.</p>
<p>I draw my plus-three Sword of Duquesne and attack in a 180-degree arc.</p>
<p>The goblins are terrified as Duquesne draws his sword from its sheath and, in one move, slices the throats of three charging goblins.</p>
<p>Oh! Good.</p>
<p>Rest of the goblins run away.</p>
<p>Great job with the sword.</p>
<p>You saved us.</p>
<p>What would we do if you didn't exist? Dial it back, Lavernica.</p>
<p>Pierce, what are you doing here? How about you answer that question? What the hell is this little tea party? We're playing Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
<p>First of all, gay.</p>
<p>Second of all, stupid.</p>
<p>And thirdly, why was this a secret? Are you cutting me out of the group? I guess we must have forgot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what it was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You remembered to invite Al Jolson.</p>
<p>And you remembered to let fatty sit in my chair.</p>
<p>Out! You're stretching it.</p>
<p>Can we talk to you outside for a second? Kind of missed that opportunity already.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there's a very specific reason.</p>
<p>Let's play.</p>
<p>I don't have a character for you.</p>
<p>I don't need a character.</p>
<p>I think you do.</p>
<p>Just put me in the stupid game now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, as you watch the goblins retreat, you notice a 67-year-old naked man with no weapons lying in the wet grass shivering.</p>
<p>His name is Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>And I'm 66, dick.</p>
<p>In about 13 turns, he will die of exposure.</p>
<p>Jeff? I wait 14 turns.</p>
<p>Screw you guys.</p>
<p>I'm gonna win.</p>
<p>I go to the naked man and I give him my cloak.</p>
<p>Pierce, I am Duquesne, of Clan Duquesne.</p>
<p>Dumb name.</p>
<p>I'm going to take his sword.</p>
<p>Can I take his sword? You've got his sword.</p>
<p>Pierce, knock it off.</p>
<p>You're playing the game wrong.</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
<p>Okay, I take the sword from the man.</p>
<p>I attack him, I attack black face.</p>
<p>It's a critical hit.</p>
<p>Wha? You decapitated him.</p>
<p>Brutalitops is dead.</p>
<p>What? No! Chang, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for your character sheet.</p>
<p>Still your turn.</p>
<p>I run.</p>
<p>What? You run? Naked man is running into the woods.</p>
<p>He has my sword.</p>
<p>Can we catch him, please? The cloak was an elven cloak of wind walking, which is double-speed, so no.</p>
<p>He's gone.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>It took me 10 years and 50 campaigns to get that sword.</p>
<p>Really? Maybe I'll wipe my ass with it and throw it off a cliff.</p>
<p>That's for sitting in my chair, fatty.</p>
<p>I take it that means I'm winning? Pierce, you've made your point.</p>
<p>You can ruin anything.</p>
<p>Now come back and give Neil his sword.</p>
<p>Can't hear you over the sound of me rubbing his sword on my balls.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Oh, ew.</p>
<p>You have successfully rubbed your balls on the sword.</p>
<p>Abed, don't help him.</p>
<p>You're the Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>Just kill Pierce and give Neil back his sword.</p>
<p>He's upset.</p>
<p>I have to be impartial or the game has no meaning.</p>
<p>Can you give Neil a new sword? That sword is one-of-a-kind, forged by my ancestors.</p>
<p>I hump it.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Pierce, Abed, I need to have a talk with you in the hall.</p>
<p>What? Hey, hey.</p>
<p>That kid in there is severely depressed.</p>
<p>Is that what he told you? He's been using that line since he was 5 years old to get an extra slice of pie.</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with you? I don't like being excluded, Jeff.</p>
<p>Do you? Yes.</p>
<p>Now go in there and tell him you're giving him his sword or you are out of the group.</p>
<p>I'm sick of you threatening me and talking to me like a kid and giving me that look you give me like I can't get erections.</p>
<p>What? Abed, I keep running.</p>
<p>Since you're working against the group, I need to separate you.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Who wants to sit with a bunch of fat cry-babies anyway? Call me when you're ready for my next move.</p>
<p>Pierce refuses to give back the sword.</p>
<p>Our new goal is to find him and kill him.</p>
<p>I think I just wanna go home.</p>
<p>Neil, do not do that.</p>
<p>We're gonna get that sword.</p>
<p>Is there a way of moving faster than he's moving in his cape of whatever? I guess if we had a Pegasus.</p>
<p>If that's sarcasm, I can't tell, because everything in this game is silly.</p>
<p>Um, Abed, can we get a Pegasus? I can't give you information like that.</p>
<p>Well, there's got to be a town nearby.</p>
<p>We will go to that town and ask around about a Pegasus.</p>
<p>Huzzah.</p>
<p>Is that right? And so it was that the group began to describe themselves walking.</p>
<p>And as they described themselves walking, so did Abed confirm they walked.</p>
<p>I walk with them.</p>
<p>Until This is a local elf tavern, but all races are welcome.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>It's a crowded, rowdy evening.</p>
<p>Beleaguered gnomes hurry with mead for the thirsty elves.</p>
<p>Why are they beleaguered? Who cares? I find a waiter and introduce myself.</p>
<p>Why is he a pirate? He only speaks gnome.</p>
<p>Anybody here speak gnome?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Lavernica does.</p>
<p>This will be painless.</p>
<p>Hello, my friend and brother.</p>
<p>How can I help you, dear madam? Oh, please, no need for such deference.</p>
<p>I'm no better than a gnome.</p>
<p>You are, madam.</p>
<p>You are a human warrior, which is five species classes greater than I.</p>
<p>That's disgusting.</p>
<p>Don't talk like that.</p>
<p>I am so sorry, madam.</p>
<p>Please don't report me for execution.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.</p>
<p>We've gotta do something about these gnomes.</p>
<p>Um, Britta, ask the stupid gnome where we can get a Pegasus.</p>
<p>Did someone say "Pegasus"? A word I understand in every language.</p>
<p>Okay, here's all the Dungeons & Dragons stuff I could find.</p>
<p>I had to carry it all the way from my car.</p>
<p>It's very heavy, and my doctor said Following the directions given to you, you arrive at a field of Pegasi.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>But they are guarded by a mysterious and beautiful elf maiden who seems drawn to Mar.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I explain that we need a Pegasus and, I don't know, promise to fill it up before we bring it back.</p>
<p>She flirts with you.</p>
<p>I flirt back.</p>
<p>How? I say something sexy.</p>
<p>Like what? Abed.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I don't normally do this, but you are the most beautiful creature I've ever seen, and I would really love a Pegasus.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Works for me.</p>
<p>You're very handsome, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, I'm not really comfortable with this.</p>
<p>My stable has a bedding of heather.</p>
<p>You'd be more comfortable indoors.</p>
<p>Look at what you're doing.</p>
<p>Understand I don't want to.</p>
<p>You've offended the elf maiden.</p>
<p>She seems disinterested.</p>
<p>What? All right, can we just do this? Hi, hello.</p>
<p>I'm Hector the Well-Endowed.</p>
<p>You got a bunch of Pegasi.</p>
<p>Let's make a deal.</p>
<p>What kind of deal? I take her by the hand and lead her to the stable.</p>
<p>Light a candle and rip off a piece of my tunic, which I fashion into a blindfold.</p>
<p>I'd like to, but I don't know if I --</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>I place it gently over the elf maiden's eyes.</p>
<p>I slowly --</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You both fall back, exhausted but still entwined.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I stroke her hair lovingly and spoon her for the appropriate amount of time.</p>
<p>How long is that?</p>
<p>Cool, cool.</p>
<p>The elf maiden, thoroughly satisfied, promises you a flock of Pegasi.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Take a break.</p>
<p>I should check on Pierce.</p>
<p>Pierce? I'm here.</p>
<p>I need to know what you want to do next.</p>
<p>So many things, Abed.</p>
<p>So many things.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>I am bringing Pierce back into the room.</p>
<p>While soaring above the forest of Ingold you spot a body in an elven cloak in a clearing below.</p>
<p>Ha! Oh.</p>
<p>We got you, dummy.</p>
<p>We land.</p>
<p>You land safely in the clearing.</p>
<p>He's face-down, a pool of blood underneath him.</p>
<p>I've dreamed of this moment, in the game.</p>
<p>Uh, Neil's sword? Clutched in the hand is the sword of Duquesne.</p>
<p>Sir, I believe this is yours.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You get close to take the sword.</p>
<p>You can see that this body, while definitely dying, is not Pierce.</p>
<p>What? I turn it over.</p>
<p>It's the gnome waiter from the tavern.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Goodbye, my friend.</p>
<p>Thank you for being so respectful toward me.</p>
<p>Who did this to you, Gnome Waiter? I never saw his face.</p>
<p>But just so you know, My name was Kyle.</p>
<p>Kyle.</p>
<p>Britta? He was an imaginary waiter.</p>
<p>I wouldn't expect you to understand.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>You hear a low rumble on the other side of the trees, followed by a shrill screech and the beating of heavy wings.</p>
<p>Wait, wings? What's going on? Tell me, Abed.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Amburg region of the Edylmann river basin? Of course, I am.</p>
<p>You know there's a reflecting pool with a very special amulet at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>An amulet that allows the wearer full control over Draconis? The hideous Draconis, an all-powerful red dragon, crashes through the trees into the clearing.</p>
<p>Riding atop his shoulders, naked as the day he was born and controlling Draconis with the amulet is Say it.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Scream what I told you to scream.</p>
<p>Pierce Hawthorne is my master.</p>
<p>Prepare to meet your doom.</p>
<p>I run towards Pierce with my broadsword drawn and I attack Time stop.</p>
<p>Time stop? Draconis has tons of spells.</p>
<p>The six of you are frozen and helpless.</p>
<p>I wanted to play Chutes and Ladders.</p>
<p>Fine, Pierce, you win.</p>
<p>Just kill us and end this.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Killing's too good for you.</p>
<p>Cast shape change on Duquesne.</p>
<p>What shape do you choose for him? Fat.</p>
<p>Pierce, stop it.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Duquesne starts gaining weight.</p>
<p>How much? Make him as fat as Fat Neil.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Oh, right, cry.</p>
<p>Let it out.</p>
<p>Baste your chubby cheeks in tears of gravy.</p>
<p>You weren't crying when you were stealing my friends.</p>
<p>They asked me to come here.</p>
<p>You know why, right? I've got some fat news for you, Fat Neil.</p>
<p>Don't you know why Jeff Winger, of all people, led the charge on the Fat Neil feel-good committee? Way over the line, Pierce.</p>
<p>I'll tell you why, because I was there.</p>
<p>Oh, they're down there by Fat Neil.</p>
<p>That's right, Neil.</p>
<p>Your new best friend, Jeff Winger, coined the name Fat Neil.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Neil, look, before you respond, I can make it up to you.</p>
<p>I'll find a fatter Neil.</p>
<p>Huzzah.</p>
<p>You made up Fat Neil? Someone asked where the restrooms were.</p>
<p>You were standing by them, but you were also standing kind of near, uh, other Neil.</p>
<p>So call him Skinny Neil.</p>
<p>He's not that skinny.</p>
<p>He's bald, he's black.</p>
<p>I don't look at the world through that lens.</p>
<p>I shouldn't be high-roading you.</p>
<p>I'm the bad guy.</p>
<p>You can all hang out in suspended humiliation and think about what you learned today.</p>
<p>One, don't screw with me.</p>
<p>Two, invite me to your crap.</p>
<p>Is it my turn? Yes, but you can't move.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>For my turn, I feel sorry for Pierce Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Pfft.</p>
<p>Save it.</p>
<p>No, I really do, man.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>For my turn, I rape the Duquesne family again.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>For my turn, I pity Pierce too.</p>
<p>Trust me, kitten, I'm having the time of my life.</p>
<p>I won.</p>
<p>I won Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
<p>And it was advanced.</p>
<p>I pity Pierce.</p>
<p>Knock it off.</p>
<p>You really outdid yourself this week.</p>
<p>There's pain in you.</p>
<p>I seriously feel bad.</p>
<p>Feel sorry for your new fat BFF.</p>
<p>No, we're done doing that.</p>
<p>He's gonna be fine.</p>
<p>Aren't you, Neil? You, Pierce, I really worry about.</p>
<p>At least for my turn anyway.</p>
<p>Well, how about this? Draconis, unfreeze time.</p>
<p>Done, you guys can move again.</p>
<p>I breathe so much fire on you Hold it.</p>
<p>You just used your move unfreezing time.</p>
<p>Neil? I take the sword of Duquesne, and I throw it at the amulet around the sad naked man's neck.</p>
<p>That's a difficult shot.</p>
<p>You'll need an 18 or higher.</p>
<p>Oh, sweet baby Jesus.</p>
<p>Come on, come on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo! Yes, in your face.</p>
<p>Sword smashes the amulet, freeing Draconis from its spell.</p>
<p>Red dragon turns his head, grabs Pierce in his jaws, swallows him alive.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Oh, Neil.</p>
<p>He flies your band to his cavern where he bestows his treasure upon you.</p>
<p>Congratulations on the completion of Caverns of Draconis.</p>
<p>I've been your Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>I hope you had a good time.</p>
<p>Excelsior.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Awesome game.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>That was the best game I ever played in my life.</p>
<p>Don't mention it.</p>
<p>Wanna play again next week? Maybe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'll be around.</p>
<p>And so it was that Pierce Hawthorne saved the life of Fat Neil while learning very, very little.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>How could you want giant ears over a tail? If you had a tail, people could tell you're happy.</p>
<p>You'd hear things from miles away and wear backpacks as earrings.</p>
<p>Free up your hands.</p>
<p>Backpacks already free up your hands.</p>
<p>Guys, what do you think? Oh.</p>
<p>We thought our group was meeting now.</p>
<p>Tail is much better.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>All in favor of giant ears: Hm.</p>
<p>Told you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
