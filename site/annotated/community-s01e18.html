<div id="transcript">
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Haven't seen you all day.</p>
<p>Hah.</p>
<p>I've been really busy.</p>
<p>Plus I had to find 30 extra chairs for my classroom since it's Family Day.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Speaking of, I was gonna invite my mom so you could meet her but, uh, she still thinks I'm a lawyer.</p>
<p>Oh, look.</p>
<p>A Human Being has a little Human with it.</p>
<p>How bloodcurdlingly adorable.</p>
<p>Jeff, we need to talk.</p>
<p>What's wrong? Are you breaking up with me? Oh.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>Maybe we don't need to talk.</p>
<p>I'm so excited for everybody to meet my sons.</p>
<p>Hope they're not twins.</p>
<p>Twins freak me out.</p>
<p>They always know what the other one is --</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thinking? And finishing each other's --</p>
<p>Pie.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It's creepy.</p>
<p>It's nice spending time with them.</p>
<p>I don't get to see them that much since I started school.</p>
<p>My sister likes to joke they don't recognize me anymore, and I like to joke she's just jealous because she's barren.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>My dad's bringing cousin Abra.</p>
<p>She's visiting from Gaza.</p>
<p>Does she look like you, but in a wig and lipstick? No, that's <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Halle Berry</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000932">Halle Berry</a></span><span class="years">1966&ndash;</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">actress</span><span class="tag prof">producer</span><span class="tag prof">executive</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460">tt0246460</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285742">tt0285742</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327554">tt0327554</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348836">tt0348836</a></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Abra wears a full burka in public so she just looks like someone covered head to toe in black fabric.</p>
<p>I can't believe my grandma's rolling her old bones down here.</p>
<p>I gotta pick a cabinet to hide in.</p>
<p>You hide from her? Yeah, she's crazy.</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>Society programs us to dispose of the elderly because they don't work or buy things, but don't be blind to your grandmother's value.</p>
<p>You need to cherish her.</p>
<p>You cherish her.</p>
<p>I'm sure I will.</p>
<p>She's not gonna be around forever.</p>
<p>I wanna believe you're right, Britta, but you never quite are, are you? Sorry, I'm late.</p>
<p>Was somebody canoodling with a certain professor? Actually, no.</p>
<p>She dumped me.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that's so sad.</p>
<p>I'll give Jeff a shoulder to cry on.</p>
<p>You boys put a dead bird in that bitch's glove compartment.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, sit.</p>
<p>Shirley, I don't need to cry.</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>Jeff, we're your friends.</p>
<p>Let it all out.</p>
<p>There's nothing to let out.</p>
<p>I'm just glad I didn't have to do the dumping.</p>
<p>Then I'd have to lay low for three weeks to look sensitive.</p>
<p>To avoid questions of overlap, but as the dumpee, heh, I can start making out with every girl on campus now and all anyone will feel for me is sorry.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Your heart's desensitized, Jeff.</p>
<p>You're like a machine.</p>
<p>It feels no love, just sex.</p>
<p>You're like the Booty-nator.</p>
<p>You know, Booty-nator? Like "I'll be back," but with booty.</p>
<p>Why would Booty-nator be back with booty? Wouldn't he just try and kill it? Well, maybe he kills it, then brings it back as a trophy.</p>
<p>Why would he want dead booty? I want pirate's booty.</p>
<p>Because you're hungry? Guys.</p>
<p>I'll be back, but with booty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's beneath you.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>Well, you're too gorgeous to be a teacher and you're too happy to be a student.</p>
<p>Take me to where your car broke down.</p>
<p>I'm here for Family Day.</p>
<p>I'm looking for my family.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, at the very least, I could fill in for a creepy uncle.</p>
<p>Jeff.</p>
<p>Amber.</p>
<p>There she is.</p>
<p>Look at you, all grown up.</p>
<p>Jeff, this is my stepdaughter, Amber.</p>
<p>Small world.</p>
<p>No, actually, it's a very big world with --</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Come on, I'll show you around.</p>
<p>I'm back.</p>
<p>Without booty.</p>
<p>Now I feel sorry for you.</p>
<p>Hands in the air.</p>
<p>Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Boys, leave that man alone.</p>
<p>Orange alert.</p>
<p>Orange alert.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>They're just excited.</p>
<p>You're, uh, Abed's father? I'm Shirley.</p>
<p>And that's Elijah like the prophet and Jordan like the 14-time NBA All-Star.</p>
<p>Gubi Nadir.</p>
<p>Is it how you say hello?</p>
<p>That's my name.</p>
<p>Oh! I'm sorry, you, you're like a black ghost.</p>
<p>This is my cousin, Abra.</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>Over the course of seven marriages, I amassed some 32 stepchildren and obviously, Amber's my favorite.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was something about his mass e-mails that made me certain this would be a family reunion.</p>
<p>It sure is, sweetie.</p>
<p>She's going to photography school.</p>
<p>Oh, sounds interesting.</p>
<p>Keep it in your pants.</p>
<p>You're embarrassing yourself.</p>
<p>She may be hot, but she's my princess.</p>
<p>Step princess.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Family Day.</p>
<p>Let's see what we got here.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I can't believe Star-Burns isn't a virgin.</p>
<p>But judging from that Bluetooth headset, his son is.</p>
<p>Ch-chang! Winger.</p>
<p>Too cool for family? Everyone here is my family.</p>
<p>Oh, weak.</p>
<p>Cute.</p>
<p>Where's your family, El Tigre? Ugh.</p>
<p>My older brother will be at the barbecue.</p>
<p>And it's none of your business, but I ate my twin in utero.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey, <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Phantom Menace</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915">Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1999&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Action</span><span class="tag genre">Adventure</span><span class="tag genre">Fantasy</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>How's the trade embargo with the Naboo? Anyway -- oh, looks like Pierce broke the piggy bank at the escort service this time.</p>
<p>Hey, duck sauce.</p>
<p>That was rude.</p>
<p>The call girls I frequent are not nearly as attractive as my daughter.</p>
<p>Stepdaughter.</p>
<p>Technically, ex-stepdaughter.</p>
<p>You know, your mother April --</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Wanda, her name's --</p>
<p>Was it Wanda? Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I need one sec.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Uh, Jeff, Jeff.</p>
<p>Uh, cards on the table, Jeff.</p>
<p>Amber's the best shot I'll ever have at something like a real daughter and I'm striking out.</p>
<p>Have you told her she's prettier than a hooker? If you come to the barbecue I know you'd never think of touching her.</p>
<p>Maybe you could say a couple cool things about me.</p>
<p>You want me to wingman you with your ex-stepdaughter? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I got a thing.</p>
<p>You have a thing? Yeah, and it's on the rebound.</p>
<p>I'm not subjecting it to a night with a hot girl that I can't have.</p>
<p>You can't holster it for a friend? Please, Pierce is barely a friend.</p>
<p>He's no more related to Amber than you are, and was a total jag about shutting me down.</p>
<p>How much effort do I rate? For you? Um, I'd break a light sweat.</p>
<p>Good, I need a favor.</p>
<p>Help Pierce with his stepdaughter? You're becoming dangerous, Annie.</p>
<p>It's those doe eyes.</p>
<p>Disappointing you is like choking <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">The Little Mermaid</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160801">The Little Mermaid</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1976&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Family</span><span class="tag genre">Fantasy</span><span class="tag genre">Musical</span></span></span></span> with a bike chain.</p>
<p>Is this Nana Barnes? Troy didn't mention you were such a knockout.</p>
<p>What's that supposed to mean? Oh.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've broken a few hearts in your time.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>How many men do you think I've laid with? Who are you? I am Britta.</p>
<p>And I have offended you and I am sorry.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can get you? Yes.</p>
<p>You can get me a switch.</p>
<p>A what now? She's not family, Nana.</p>
<p>You can't make her get a switch.</p>
<p>She can make me get it.</p>
<p>I just have to know what it is.</p>
<p>A switch is a stick she can use to whoop you with.</p>
<p>Cherish, Britta.</p>
<p>Cherish.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Well, it was wonderful meeting your brother.</p>
<p>Adios, Señor Chang, shalom, Rabbi Chang, and to both of you, sayonara.</p>
<p>Don't go.</p>
<p>Señor Chang? Ben, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds? Okay, that is who I am.</p>
<p>So drop it.</p>
<p>Dropping.</p>
<p>I'm dropping.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Amber alert.</p>
<p>You are allergic to peanuts.</p>
<p>That might be a different step-kid.</p>
<p>My flight actually leaves so --</p>
<p>Your flight actually leaves after I tell you a story called: Pierce Takes On The School Bully.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Are you a ninja --</p>
<p>Oh, baby.</p>
<p>Don't be rude.</p>
<p>Uh, she's wearing a burka.</p>
<p>It's a way women to express their modesty.</p>
<p>They're like Islamic turtlenecks.</p>
<p>Ask her if she wants to play with us.</p>
<p>Bouncy house.</p>
<p>Sounds heated.</p>
<p>Did she call him a pig's anus or something? She's saying she's old enough to jump in a giant balloon.</p>
<p>She's saying he's overprotective.</p>
<p>Now she says he's a pig anus.</p>
<p>That fight made me crave a hot dog.</p>
<p>Stay put, boys.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Look at them.</p>
<p>You are a bad mother.</p>
<p>Control your children.</p>
<p>I have to go back to my car and get my emergency shirt.</p>
<p>And I don't even like that shirt.</p>
<p>Not only did he join a band, they got jealous and booted him.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Heh-heh.</p>
<p>That's exactly what they said.</p>
<p>Off to the bathroom, stepdad.</p>
<p>I've never been called stepdad.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone has.</p>
<p>Listen, when she gets back, come up with some reason why you have to leave, okay? I'll beg you to stay, but you don't.</p>
<p>In fact, why don't you just leave now.</p>
<p>Cut our work in half.</p>
<p>Good luck, buddy.</p>
<p>You're leaving? My girlfriend is pregnant.</p>
<p>Pierce said you were gay.</p>
<p>He -- Yup.</p>
<p>As the sunrise.</p>
<p>And I'm deeply ashamed.</p>
<p>I'm just glad I have friends like Pierce to keep me --</p>
<p>Honest.</p>
<p>This is slightly wrong.</p>
<p>Too much tongue? Just enough.</p>
<p>But it -- it's Pierce.</p>
<p>You mean the guy who decided he doesn't want men touching his ex-stepdaughter, but divorced Mom for our housekeeper? Could be the same guy, yeah.</p>
<p>Amber? Amber, there you are.</p>
<p>Why are you here, Jeff? I go to school here, remember? Ahem.</p>
<p>There's a Pictionary tournament in the student lounge.</p>
<p>Sounds fun.</p>
<p>Is Jeff joining us? I don't know if he can, can you? I can't.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Come on, stay.</p>
<p>Stay.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn't, either.</p>
<p>Stay, Jeff.</p>
<p>You think I should? I think you have to.</p>
<p>I'll stay.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Good Family Day.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Getting Nana a switch.</p>
<p>Britta, stop pretending that my mean old nana is awesome.</p>
<p>I'm not pretending.</p>
<p>I think it's cool that she's got her own style of discipline.</p>
<p>Nana's old school.</p>
<p>Yeah, my mom told me there'd be white people that did this.</p>
<p>With the pocket watches and coffee grinders, and pretending to be into steamboats.</p>
<p>But let's get this straight.</p>
<p>This is real life.</p>
<p>My Nana is gonna whoop you.</p>
<p>Not unless I find her a switch.</p>
<p>How about this? Yeah, that's a great switch, Britta.</p>
<p>Very hip.</p>
<p>Should hurt a lot.</p>
<p>Uh, where's Elijah and Jordan? Uh, Abed? Oh, what a surprise that you lost them.</p>
<p>They're playing hide and seek.</p>
<p>Uh, where? I don't think that's how it works.</p>
<p>Stop screwing around, Abed.</p>
<p>Hey, you want to yell at someone? Go find your crazy kids.</p>
<p>My boy is disciplined.</p>
<p>It's not his job --</p>
<p>All right, you got me, Gubi.</p>
<p>I'm a bad mother.</p>
<p>I let my kids be kids instead of acting like a jail warden.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>You don't like her burka? I'm not talking about the burka.</p>
<p>I'm talking about her never having any fun.</p>
<p>Now, Abra, you look me in the eyes and you tell me --</p>
<p>Um, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I seemed to have forgotten the napkins.</p>
<p>Do -- do you mind? Fine.</p>
<p>Now I'm the napkin man.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Circle.</p>
<p>Circle with a squiggly line.</p>
<p>Uh, squiggly line circle.</p>
<p>You -- You did hear me say circle.</p>
<p>Smiling sideways vagina.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Happy sideways vagina.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Happy face.</p>
<p>And that's a clam? As happy as a clam.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As happy as a clam? What a gay guess.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>Pierce, you're up.</p>
<p>Eat my dust, Winger.</p>
<p>You do know we're on the same team? Go.</p>
<p>Uh, all right, here we go.</p>
<p>Uh, let's see.</p>
<p>Look, I don't, uh, Pierce you have to add more.</p>
<p>Draw more.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop circling the same thing.</p>
<p>Well, guess something, you girlfriend-less geek.</p>
<p>What are you drawing? You're supposed to know, stupid.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>I'll get this.</p>
<p>I think they'll both drop charges, but we gotta take statements.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a while.</p>
<p>And I may just be a simple cop, but people need to know.</p>
<p>This isn't gonna stop until Pictionary bans the word windmill.</p>
<p>Pierce, we'll meet you at the gala.</p>
<p>We're gonna go get you some coffee.</p>
<p>Is coffee code for sex? Is it? No.</p>
<p>Nana, here's your switch.</p>
<p>Bring it here.</p>
<p>I'll make do.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me have it.</p>
<p>I ain't no nun.</p>
<p>Bend over.</p>
<p>Drop your pants and get over my lap.</p>
<p>All you have to do is walk away.</p>
<p>What are you doing? She's respecting her elders.</p>
<p>See, Troy? Did you think I was a hypocrite? That I wouldn't really -- Okay, that really -- Oh! Okay, that really -- I don't understand you, Britta.</p>
<p>I don't understand you at all.</p>
<p>You know what? Totally wrong room.</p>
<p>Will you get the door? Uh, she's had enough.</p>
<p>Oh, she's had enough.</p>
<p>Let's focus on you, the forbidden fruit that is the ex-stepdaughter of a casual acquaintance.</p>
<p>Oh, oops.</p>
<p>Don't wanna lose that.</p>
<p>Why do you have a $25,000 check from Pierce? Tuition for fashion school.</p>
<p>Not photography school? You caught me.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe I'll just buy a car.</p>
<p>And you can just do that, huh? Well, it helps that he's kind of desperate and stupid.</p>
<p>Did you wanna be a good person right now or did you wanna be with me? Oh, there you are.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Pollyanna.</p>
<p>You made me hang out with Pierce and his stepdaughter.</p>
<p>She's grifting him.</p>
<p>She's what? She's taking a bunch of money from him.</p>
<p>He thinks it's for school, but it's for grifting.</p>
<p>Did you tell him? It's not that simple.</p>
<p>It's not? Oh, my -- Jeff.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>You're gross.</p>
<p>You did it with her? Yeah, but not twice.</p>
<p>I wanted to do it twice.</p>
<p>That's gross.</p>
<p>You met her this morning.</p>
<p>You're faster than some bacteria.</p>
<p>Are you just doing this because Slater hurt you? What? No, I'm not hurt.</p>
<p>And Amber threw herself at me.</p>
<p>Well, you still have to tell Pierce that she's taking advantage of him, don't you? Well, when you think about it, nobody's getting hurt.</p>
<p>Pierce is getting a daughter, Amber's getting an allowance, I'm getting --</p>
<p>We already talked about it.</p>
<p>But don't forget this is Pierce.</p>
<p>He's a racist, homophobic old goof.</p>
<p>He does bad stuff all the time.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like you've got it all figured out, so why are you talking to me about it? Because you're -- you know.</p>
<p>A decent person? Maybe.</p>
<p>And you knew talking to me about it would make you feel like a bad friend.</p>
<p>You wanted to feel like a bad friend because you wanna be a good friend? You really suck, you know that? Mm, mm, mm! Go get you and your brother some Ding Dongs and calm down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What's up? Oh.</p>
<p>Abed, did your family take off? Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for distracting my dad while we helped Abra get back in her burka.</p>
<p>Well, if a young lady wants to go in a bouncy house, she should go.</p>
<p>It was a noble thing you did.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn't do it.</p>
<p>No, it was Jordan and Elijah's idea.</p>
<p>They're good kids.</p>
<p>If they weren't, they wouldn't help Abra.</p>
<p>I see why you were so excited for me to meet them.</p>
<p>You should be proud of them.</p>
<p>You're a good mom.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Hey, Mom.</p>
<p>Look what I got.</p>
<p>Ding Dongs, my favorite.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Pretty rough, huh? Mm.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>Nana is a monster.</p>
<p>What did you say? I said you were a monster, ma'am.</p>
<p>And you said Troy was right.</p>
<p>Get me a switch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, stranger.</p>
<p>Wanna pick up where we left off after I log some time with Daddy Warbucks? No, Amber.</p>
<p>Uh, I thought about it and what I want is for you to tear up that check and go dance with your stepdad.</p>
<p>Are you trying to get me to cut you in? You don't have leverage.</p>
<p>If I walk over there and tell him everything, guess who he'll forgive.</p>
<p>You, but I'd rather be the bad guy than watch you siphon him.</p>
<p>How about this? I walk away and if the check clears, I won't make problems for you.</p>
<p>I'll stay gone.</p>
<p>Come back whenever you want, but be good to him when you do because I'll be around.</p>
<p>I'm his friend.</p>
<p>And you can be his stepdaughter, or not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'll take the 25 grand.</p>
<p>Over him, I'd take 25 cents.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Have you seen Amber? Yeah.</p>
<p>Listen, Pierce.</p>
<p>Uh, I gotta tell you something.</p>
<p>She's not coming, is she? I wrote her a pretty big check this afternoon.</p>
<p>I had a feeling she might take it and run.</p>
<p>You want me to help you cancel it? Oh, hell, she earned it.</p>
<p>You're lucky, Jeff.</p>
<p>It's not too late for you.</p>
<p>Have a family.</p>
<p>Share your life.</p>
<p>That and understanding computers are two things you just can't knock out at the end.</p>
<p>Pierce, who did you call last week after you farted on Vaughn? Ha-ha.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>And who did Abed call after that squirrel stole his hotdog? Me.</p>
<p>That's sharing your life.</p>
<p>If you have friends, you have family.</p>
<p>Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Come here, son.</p>
<p>Are we hugging or dancing? You know, if the roles were reversed, I would have had sex with your ex-stepdaughter.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Chip off the old block.</p>
<p>It was either that or deal with your actual pain.</p>
<p>What pain? Twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Oh, are you kidding me? It's okay, it's okay.</p>
<p>Let it out.</p>
<p>We always used to watch the shows she wanted to watch.</p>
<p>I hate <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Glee</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327801">Glee</a></span><span class="titleType">tvSeries</span><span class="years">2009&ndash;2015</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Comedy</span><span class="tag genre">Drama</span><span class="tag genre">Music</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>I'm not crazy about <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Glee</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327801">Glee</a></span><span class="titleType">tvSeries</span><span class="years">2009&ndash;2015</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Comedy</span><span class="tag genre">Drama</span><span class="tag genre">Music</span></span></span></span>, either.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>

<p>Why did we do this again? We thought it looked fun.</p>
<p>Is your cell phone in your pocket? Yeah, but I can't reach it.</p>
<p>I can only move my right arm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There's money already in there.</p>
<p>Slide your arm through that bottom slot and press the button G-14.</p>

<p>We could pick it up and call for help.</p>
