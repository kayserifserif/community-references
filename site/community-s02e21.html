<p>I can't believe this is our 20th and final anthropology diorama of the year.</p>
<p>I can't believe our assignment is making a diorama of us making our 19th diorama.</p>
<p>That's kind of weird.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>My forehead is not this big.</p>
<p>Troy, can you pass me that paintbrush? My monkey! My monkey took that paintbrush and went into that vent.</p>
<p>Oh, I miss him so much.</p>
<p>Someone's got to go after him.</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Trust me.</p>
<p>I know these vents like the back of my Chang.</p>
<p>Holy That a new stereotype? Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Did you find him? Is that a new stereotype? No, and no.</p>
<p>But there's all kinds of stuff in here.</p>
<p>Guys, you won't believe this.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>It's like a sentimental treasure pile.</p>
<p>Oh, that's my spoon.</p>
<p>No! Oh, Hubba Bubba.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I thought they stopped making this.</p>
<p>And that's all of it.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That means you can put your clothes back on.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>I'm going back in.</p>
<p>Why? Monkey took my spoon.</p>
<p>It's like a reverse cow birth.</p>
<p>Annie, look! All of your purple pens are here.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you got so mad because you thought someone was stealing them? There are so many memories in this pile.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>The deputy's badge from when we spent that day in that old ghost town.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We have to find the saloon.</p>
<p>Every building is a saloon.</p>
<p>We gotta go! Get the tarnation back here, you city-slicking sons of Aah! Eh.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>That was one of the best days of the year.</p>
<p>I almost forgot about it.</p>
<p>We almost got shot.</p>
<p>Yeah, but by a prospector in red long underwear.</p>
<p>How cool was that? Glad you had fun.</p>
<p>By the way, that dude was hard-core racist, like 1800s Disney-style.</p>
<p>We learned new ways to hate ourselves.</p>
<p>Hey, glee club trophy.</p>
<p>You guys remember when we had to fill in for glee club? Guys, that's not a fond memory.</p>
<p>We won, like, 70 awards.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the reason we had to fill in for glee club was because they died.</p>
<p>Their bus crashed.</p>
<p>I know, but I was remembering around that part.</p>
<p>Yeah, focus on the positives, like we got that cool new bus driver.</p>
<p>Nice try, Britta, but it's been a dark year.</p>
<p>Pierce got hooked on painkillers.</p>
<p>Shirley's having an unplanned baby.</p>
<p>Apparently, Chang is in the group? It's true.</p>
<p>God hates us.</p>
<p>Remember when Abed had a total mental breakdown at Christmas? That was adorable and magical.</p>
<p>He thought everything was claymation.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But everything wasn't.</p>
<p>And what do you see now, Abed? A candy cane forest.</p>
<p>We're all running through the candy cane forest.</p>
<p>Oh, careful, don't trip on a gumdrop.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I tripped! On a gumdrop! Yay.</p>
<p>Let's find Santa some more.</p>
<p>Well, I think this year was awesome.</p>
<p>Full of good times with great people.</p>
<p>Come on, you guys.</p>
<p>Stop focusing on all the bad stuff and dig deep.</p>
<p>Abed, you're a computer.</p>
<p>Scan your mainframe for some juicy memories.</p>
<p>Jeff and Britta are having secret sex.</p>
<p>Oh! Uh, Exhibit A, the one thing I do remember from Halloween.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You need some help in there? Yeah, well, I can't use my hands in this costume, so - well, uh - Exhibit B.</p>
<p>Something I overheard during Christmas.</p>
<p>Why would I want to be in a school that hates Christmas? He's got a point.</p>
<p>Kidding.</p>
<p>What are you doing later? How about some holiday benefits? Hey.</p>
<p>Lxnay in front of Uncan-day.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Finally, exhibit C, the curious circumstances following the exciting conclusion of our St. Patrick's Day adventure.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh! Abed! Uh -- Uh, uh -- A leprechaun took our clothes.</p>
<p>And you can never tell anyone, okay? Okay, so we hooked up a few times, but there's a much larger issue here.</p>
<p>We are friends with a grown man that clearly believes in leprechauns.</p>
<p>Didn't we decide at the beginning that for the good of the group we wouldn't allow any intimacy between each other or ourselves? Troy, we never said ourselves.</p>
<p>Okay, now I'm really mad.</p>
<p>So am I.</p>
<p>Now we know why our year's been so horrible.</p>
<p>It's not God that hates us.</p>
<p>It's Jeff and Britta.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>If we were ruining your year, why didn't you know about it? Maybe we were so distracted by all the other times you put yourselves before the group.</p>
<p>What? When have we ever put ourselves before the group? You want examples? I think they want some examples.</p>
<p>Okay, let's give them some examples.</p>
<p>Troy, drop a beat.</p>
<p>Just give them some examples.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Chipmunk.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Impressive, Mr. Winger.</p>
<p>Someone's going to regionals.</p>
<p>It's a special cape.</p>
<p> A cape for justice.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>There's rioting in Tunisia! The Cape is premiering.</p>
<p>Humanity is premiering, you jags.</p>
<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>These people are giving out free iPhones!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>No! This habitat was for humanity.</p>
<p>Whoever did it, step forward.</p>
<p>You five are in big trouble.</p>
<p>Jeff and Britta, you're free to go.</p>
<p>Because you didn't step forward, and are therefore innocent.</p>
<p>You can't ignore the facts.</p>
<p>You two are ruining this group.</p>
<p>Just because we're good-Iooking doesn't make us villains.</p>
<p>Are you sure you guys have the group's best interests at heart? Feast your ear tongues on these memory pops.</p>
<p>Pierce, you've had three flu shots.</p>
<p>That's for the day-care center.</p>
<p>I'll be a living god! I'm glad you're considering the exciting opportunity of selling Lady Miss Lady cosmetics.</p>
<p>Please, open your starter kits.</p>
<p>Okay, now that the seals have been broken, you each owe me $50.</p>
<p>I'm Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>Does this hard-boiled egg make me look fat?</p>
<p>My name is Jeff Winger.</p>
<p>I love working this BlackBerry because it tones my thumbs.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>It was a particularly small egg.</p>
<p>That's why I was asking.</p>
<p>You can yell at me all you want.</p>
<p>I've seen enough movies to know that popping the back of a raft makes it go faster.</p>
<p>Show's gonna last three weeks! Six seasons and a movie! Pierce, you can't sneak up on me like that.</p>
<p>When I'm startled, my training takes over.</p>
<p>Hello! Those are just stories about us being cute.</p>
<p>You guys go out of your way to endanger the fabric of the group.</p>
<p>Yeah, leave our fabric alone.</p>
<p>You guys aren't seeing the bigger picture.</p>
<p>We compartmentalized our libidos for the good of the group.</p>
<p>Oh, you compartmentalized, did you? Then what's been going on with us all year? What are you talking about? I'm talking about the Annie of it all.</p>
<p>The long looks, the stolen glances.</p>
<p>The general atmosphere of "Would they, might they?" Annie, I think you're reading into some things.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Oh, give me a break.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do the same thing with Pierce and Abed.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, there's more between you and Annie than between me and Pierce.</p>
<p>How dare you? Abed, it's called chemistry.</p>
<p>I have it with everybody.</p>
<p>Everybody? I haven't felt any of that chemistry coming my way.</p>
<p>I don't know if you're racist or I intimidate you sexually, but it's one of those.</p>
<p>Dean-a-ling-a-ling.</p>
<p>I was just heading to judge our belated carnival when I heard you guys having a tiff.</p>
<p>What's the rumpus? We were debating how many times per year a man can drop in a study room in a dumb costume with irrelevant news.</p>
<p>Dean-yow! It's Feline Aids Awareness day, folks, so let's whip it in the keister.</p>
<p>Guys, Greendale's music department is flat "baroque," so we are having a fund-raiser.</p>
<p>What's dean got to do with it? Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Why, it's time to Tina "Turner" the clocks ahead.</p>
<p>Happy daylight savings! Deanie, vidi, vici! I came, I saw, I conquered the idea of a free Caesar-salad bar in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Frankly, my dear, I don't give a dean.</p>
<p>Heh, heh.</p>
<p>That's right, Greendale presents "Gone With the Windows," where we'll celebrate our new energy-conscious windows with a cotillion.</p>
<p>Heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Oop.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we don't see our patterns until they're all laid out in front of us.</p>
<p>Thank you for being so nice about it.</p>
<p>Oh, dean.</p>
<p>Dean.</p>
<p>Can we please stop fighting? We're starting to hurt innocent perverts.</p>
<p>I don't want to stop.</p>
<p>We're airing out this dirty laundry.</p>
<p>After that, we'll stop fighting forever.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that remembers our horrible camping trip? "Some-mores," not "s'mores." </p>
<p>No, you're saying it wrong.</p>
<p>I just found out about it.</p>
<p>It's pronounced "s'mores." </p>
<p>Yeah, it's a contraction of "some mores." </p>
<p>So contract it.</p>
<p>Stop saying "some-mores" unless you "can not." </p>
<p>Guys! We need to stop fighting.</p>
<p>No, we don't.</p>
<p>It's good that we're getting all this out there.</p>
<p>After this, we'll stop fighting.</p>
<p>That's what we said when we were painting Shirley's nursery.</p>
<p>I was talking about the paint.</p>
<p>You were being racist.</p>
<p>When I'm being racist, you'll know.</p>
<p>Guys! Let's not repeat events of Caesar Salad Day.</p>
<p>We need more people like Ralph Nader in this country! He was promoting automotive safety! Aah! Troy, your nose is bleeding.</p>
<p>Abed, stop being meta.</p>
<p>Why do you always take whatever happens and shove it up its own ass? He's not being meta.</p>
<p>He's pointing out what none of us acknowledge.</p>
<p>It's all of us.</p>
<p>This group is toxic.</p>
<p>We fight about fighting about fighting.</p>
<p>We're sick.</p>
<p>I hate us! Well, what do we do now? We could do what we always do.</p>
<p>Storm out in a huff and say that the group is breaking up.</p>
<p>Troy, pass me that paintbrush, please.</p>
<p>Aah! Does anybody have any iodine? How many vents are you gonna crawl out of this year? That's it.</p>
<p>We're done.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>See you all tomorrow.</p>
<p>You guys, wait.</p>
<p>I wanna say something.</p>
<p>You don't have to save us with a speech.</p>
<p>We're not breaking up.</p>
<p>So we don't need to get back together.</p>
<p>I know I don't have to, but I want to.</p>
<p>Look, we've known each other for almost two years now.</p>
<p>And, yeah, in that time, I've given a lot of speeches, but they all have one thing in common.</p>
<p>They're all different.</p>
<p>These drug runners aren't gonna execute Pierce because he's racist.</p>
<p>It's a locomotive that runs on us.</p>
<p>And the only sharks in that water Are the emotional ghosts that I like to call fear.</p>
<p>Anchovies.</p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>And the dangers of ingesting mercury.</p>
<p>Ah! Because the real bugs aren't the ones in those beds.</p>
<p>And there's no such thing as a free Caesar salad.</p>
<p>And even if there were The Cape still might find a second life on cable.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>The heart of the water is truth.</p>
<p>That water is a lie! Harrison Ford is irradiating our testicles with mi<span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Harrison Ford</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001230">Harrison Ford</a></span><span class="years">1884&ndash;1957</span><span class="profs list"><span class="tag prof">actor</span></span><span class="knownFor list"><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008351">tt0008351</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005257">tt0005257</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010837">tt0010837</a></span><span class="tag knownFor"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017201">tt0017201</a></span></span></span></span>missions! So maybe we are caught in an endless cycle of screw-ups and hurt feelings, but I choose to believe it's just the universe's way of molding us into some kind of super group.</p>
<p>Like the Traveling Wilburys.</p>
<p>Yes, Troy.</p>
<p>Like the Traveling Wilburys of pain, prepared for any insane adventure life throws our way.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to every one of them.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Oh, Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we can get through anything.</p>
<p>So it's probably okay if you and Britta want to keep, you know, hooking up.</p>
<p>I don't mind it so much.</p>
<p>I'm cool with it.</p>
<p>God cares.</p>
<p>Have fun tonight.</p>
<p>So guess we don't have to keep sneaking around anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess not.</p>
<p>Wanna stop doing this? Yeah.</p>
<p>Wanna stop doing this? Yeah.</p>
<p>It's not you, it's me.</p>
<p>It's you.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys remember the time when? Those guys don't care who they hurt, do they? You know, I still don't even know if I'm in the group.</p>
<p>Hey, you and I have had some pretty good times, huh? Ow! Ow! Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Aah! What a year.</p>
<p>Ow! Ow! Aah! Aah! Ow! Ow! Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Can I help you with anything? I care about you guys.</p>
<p>Shut up, dean.</p>
<p>You dress in stupid outfits.</p>
<p>Well, you have a right to your opinion, so I'll just leave.</p>
<p>You could have been nicer to the dean, Jeff.</p>
<p>So what? I don't care.</p>
<p>I just think there maybe could be repercussions, yo.</p>
<p>I don't care what you think.</p>
<p>I don't care about repercussions.</p>
<p>I don't care about the dean.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at that same moment, a truck full of toxic waste crashes and spills on the dean, transforming him into Mega-Dean! I don't care about anything.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I care now! Now I care! Too late.</p>
<p>I owe you guys an apology.</p>
<p>The dean runs our school.</p>
<p>He's entitled to a modicum of respect.</p>
<p>You're always so mean to him.</p>
<p>Why? It's embarrassing to admit, but sometimes I felt jealous of his interesting outfits.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, if I didn't know better, I'd say you had a crush on him.</p>
<p>I'll never tell!</p>
