<p>And then, in the season finale, they reveal the whole thing was a dream when the inspector wakes up next to a very young and very topless Cheryl Tiegs.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Even Pierce loves this show now? It's not Inspector Spacetime.</p>
<p>It's the American version, and a travesty.</p>
<p>It's obvious, sexist, and the timing is-- Honey, I'm dean.</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, Jeffrey, you are too much.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Why, I was doing some house cleaning the other day, Deana Reed style, when I realized, gosh, golly, it's been ages since we had a dance.</p>
<p>So this Friday we are going back to Greendale's golden age with an old-fashioned sock hop.</p>
<p>Health Department requires you wear shoes.</p>
<p>What a coinci-dean.</p>
<p>Throwing a dance the same day the CDC is confiscating our drinking fountains.</p>
<p>Well, placating students with a fun event.</p>
<p>Classic bread and circuses.</p>
<p>In Rome, the emperor would distract the populace by allocating money for bread and circuses.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get away from filtering everything through TV.</p>
<p>Time I showed growth.</p>
<p>"It's been three and a half seasons," the old me would've said.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it is a Sadie Hawkins dance, which means girls ask the boys.</p>
<p>Oh, I love those.</p>
<p>So, ladies, get out there and make yourselves useful.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>So there's one day a year when women are free to choose their own mates? What is this, cave-person times? I have already started on a Sadie Hawkins banner, so this is pretty much set in stone.</p>
<p>Then maybe I'll throw my own dance.</p>
<p>One that doesn't conform to your oppressive gender norms.</p>
<p>Give me a break.</p>
<p>You think a dance can just be thrown together willy-hilly? You think I decide to just do a rainforest theme and buy palm fronds and rig the sprinkler system-- ? I gotta write this down.</p>
<p>So, Britta, you're gonna throw a protest dance? Is that a thing? It is now.</p>
<p>And instead of Sadie Hawkins, my dance will honor a real feminist icon, someone who worked for women's rights every day of the year, <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Sophie B.

<p>Really? Your plan was to throw a dance honoring the singer of "Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"? And "As I Lay Me Down," which is the far superior song.</p>
<p>That is a good song.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I am throwing a <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Sophie B. Hawkins</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005001">Sophie B.

<p>And it is gonna be amazing.</p>
<p>And when people come they're gonna be like: "Damn. She straight Britta'd this." </p>
<p>Because, that's right, I'm taking it back.</p>
<p>You're really doing this? As someone who faked being a lawyer for seven years, I appreciate your commitment to the bit, but just admit you were wrong.</p>
<p>So you can say I Britta'd it? Yes.</p>
<p>That goes without saying.</p>
<p>But come on, it was a small mistake.</p>
<p>Call this off before it becomes a full-scale "Brit-astrophe." </p>
<p>I coined that.</p>
<p>If you don't wanna come to my dance, you are free to go to the Sadie Hawkins dance, which will be happening at the same time across the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Our school has limited venue options.</p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn't miss it.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing.</p>
<p>You do realize that if you call it a <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Sophie B.

<p>So, Abed, I was thinking about what you said about showing growth, and I was thinking maybe one way to do that is to meet new people and-- Where's this going? Can I set you up with a date for the dance? Blind date.</p>
<p>I've always thought of myself as more of an acquired taste, but okay.</p>
<p>If you're open to meeting someone, there's eligible ladies in my church.</p>
<p>Shirley, I'm already finding a date for Abed.</p>
<p>I asked first.</p>
<p>There's no reason we can't both help.</p>
<p>Why don't we each pick a girl and let Abed decide, instead of making it a competition? That's a competition.</p>
<p>So it is.</p>
<p>Only for the loser.</p>
<p>I need the computer.</p>
<p>There are, like, dozens of computers.</p>
<p>But my e-mail's on this one.</p>
<p>Pierce.</p>
<p>Jeez, what's up your butt? I may have lied about meaning <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Sophie B.

<p>And then I may have lied to cover that lie, and now I'm in deep lies.</p>
<p>So what? So you told a lie, big deal.</p>
<p>The important thing is never to admit it.</p>
<p>I was thinking about coming clean.</p>
<p>And give Winger the satisfaction? Hell, no.</p>
<p>Besides, anything could happen between now and that dance.</p>
<p>An asteroid could hit.</p>
<p>Do you wanna be the schmuck who apologizes just before the world ends? That kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Damn right it makes sense.</p>
<p>You're talking to the wisest man on campus.</p>
<p>Now, seriously, I need to get to my e-mail.</p>
<p>The post office is about to close.</p>

<p>I'll be spinning hits from yesterday and today.</p>
<p>Which are the same since I have Changnesia.</p>
<p>The guy's Teflon.</p>
<p>No matter how much awful he does, he keeps getting another chance.</p>
<p>He's like the Colin Farrell of people.</p>
<p>Wanna help me with Britta's dance? Could be a chance for classic high jinks.</p>
<p>In the interest of growth, I'm avoiding high jinks.</p>
<p>And capers, romps, and exploits.</p>
<p>Escapades are a gray area.</p>
<p>Ahem, Abed.</p>
<p>This is Kat.</p>
<p>Hi, Kat.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>She wants to ask you something.</p>
<p>Isn't she perfect? She's like one of those quirky girls from the movies.</p>
<p>I saw her in the cafeteria trying to pay for lunch with a song.</p>
<p>I asked if you'd go to the Sadie Hawkins dance with me into the balloon.</p>
<p>Could you hear it? Sure, I'd be happy to go with you.</p>
<p>Super-duper, Mr. Cooper.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So you chose the girl I picked.</p>
<p>It's cool.</p>
<p>It's not like it was a competition or anything.</p>
<p>Just be gentle when you tell Shirley that she was the loser.</p>
<p>Or do you want me to tell her? It's cool.</p>
<p>I'll handle it.</p>
<p>So was that girl an alien or a toddler with a growing disease? Hello, Abed.</p>
<p>I talked to a lovely girl at church and she'd be happy to go to the dance.</p>
<p>I appreciate it, but-- I hope you will consider it, and not just because saying no would crush this girl, but because I don't want you to miss the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I'd love to go to Britta's dance with her.</p>
<p>Oh, good, I'll set it up.</p>
<p>Oh, I hope this doesn't hurt Annie's feelings.</p>
<p>Maybe I should go tell her.</p>
<p>No need.</p>
<p>I'll handle it.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>At the risk of discovering I'm living parallel lives like in Awake, don't you already have a date? Yep.</p>
<p>Now I have two.</p>
<p>Which means I can do the Mo-dates-in-one-night sitcom trope.</p>
<p>I'll wear two outfits.</p>
<p>Mix up their names.</p>
<p>Hide under a table.</p>
<p>What about growth? I tried to go in a grounded direction but still ended up in an implausible situation.</p>
<p>Like Shirley said, it's a once-in-lifetime opportunity for high jinks.</p>
<p>I can't pass it up.</p>
<p>You already passed up a great opportunity for high jinks.</p>
<p>I did? Uh, duh-doy.</p>
<p>Britta's dance? You think two dates is crazy? Planning a dance is high jinks city.</p>
<p>Population: high jinks.</p>
<p>Troy, I need your help.</p>
<p>Get some ice.</p>
<p>Wacky ice.</p>
<p>The ice will be wacky.</p>
<p>Looks good, huh? I'm so excited.</p>
<p>Thank you for the corsage.</p>
<p>Oh, it matches your carnation.</p>
<p>How cute.</p>
<p>I'm glad you like it.</p>
<p>I was afraid you'd think it old-fashioned.</p>
<p>I like old-fashioned.</p>
<p>I find it refreshing.</p>
<p>Speaking of refreshing, I'm gonna get us some punch.</p>
<p>Be right back.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin.</p>
<p>Apparently I'm your DJ tonight.</p>
<p>Uh, I really don't know what I'm doing so if you have a request, please be specific.</p>
<p>I have Changnesia.</p>
<p>Can I help you? I wanted to try on a different look.</p>
<p>I'm pretty indecisive, so I may be back here a few times, if that's okay.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I'm also gonna need to check this Gideons Bible and this jelly-bean kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>Icebreakers.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Hey, Britta.</p>
<p>Where's Sophie B.? She backstage drinking Zima and counting her Beanie Babies? Sorry, I can't divulge that.</p>
<p>Stars and their privacy, you know.</p>
<p>But she'll definitely be here? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Sophie be coming.</p>

Very little money." </p>
<p>It's weird how in demand she is.</p>
<p>Good thing we booked her early.</p>
<p>Britta, we're running low on chips.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>I go to the Sadie Hawkins dance as the snack inspector doing random spot checks, and confiscate their chips.</p>
<p>All I need is a disguise.</p>
<p>Or you could just go to the supply closet and get some more chips.</p>
<p>Okay, but I still need to use the mustache probably.</p>
<p>Here, in lieu of flowers, I got you this.</p>
<p>It's quirky.</p>
<p>Thanks, governor.</p>
<p>I'll just put it in me invisible sack.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm gonna get us some punch.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>How are things going with you and Jessica? Are you two, as they say on TV, making a connection? Unless that means sex, in which case I hope you're not.</p>
<p>Things are great.</p>
<p>Actually, Jessica did mention she's cold.</p>
<p>Could she borrow your sweater? The one you wore last week.</p>
<p>I think it's still in your locker.</p>
<p>I guess I could check.</p>
<p>Could you? That'd be great.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, roomie.</p>
<p>What do you think of Kat? Did she tell you she plays the saw? I thought she was in a kazoo band? They need a rhythm section, duh.</p>
<p>Well, keep me posted.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go say hi to Britta.</p>
<p>No, don't.</p>
<p>You have something in your teeth.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>I do? What is it? Can't tell in this light.</p>
<p>But it's there.</p>
<p>You should check it in the bathroom.</p>
<p>The second-floor one.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You're a good friend.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Dance the night away Hello, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Are you enjoying the sock hop? A sock hop Britta has all but Britta'd by not Britta'ing her own dance.</p>
<p>Well, the night is young.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>I'm surprised you let her share the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn't want to.</p>
<p>But once she guaranteed the presence of a certain someone, I couldn't say no.</p>
<p>I wouldn't get your hopes up for Sophie B.-- </p>
<p>Oh, it's me.</p>
<p>Hm? Shall we dance? Whoop.</p>
<p>You reading the Bible? No spoilers.</p>
<p>I'm really hoping that things turn around for this Job guy.</p>
<p>So how do I look? Good.</p>
<p>Except you gotta lose the hat.</p>
<p>It doesn't go with the minister's daughter.</p>
<p>You know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're on two dates at once.</p>
<p>I've been watching since you came in.</p>
<p>I'm not good with faces.</p>
<p>Is that a judgmental or happy face? Heh-heh.</p>
<p>I think it's awesome.</p>
<p>It's one of my favorite bits.</p>
<p>Like when a dog acts embarrassed: Or when a guy chases the girl and does that public declaration of love.</p>
<p>It's not realistic.</p>
<p>Something private into a performance.</p>
<p>I think the dog's trained.</p>
<p>I was talking about the public declaration-- Oh, you're messing with me.</p>
<p>Yes, I was.</p>
<p>This thing's turning out to be tougher than I thought.</p>
<p>Wanna help? I'd like to, but I still got 1200 pages left of this Bible.</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>A large percentage of Greendale students sort of gave up in the mid-'90s, so for many of them, <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Sophie B.

<p>I mean, her coming here is gonna be a huge boost to their spirits.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Whereas, her not showing up would be enough to push these people to such a dark place and really question whether life is worth living at all.</p>
<p>Okay, bye-bye- So how long have you been doing Bible studies? I mean, making hats out of duct tape.</p>
<p>Oh, duct-tape hat-- Ah! You've never seen Star Wars movies? We're taught popular films are the devil.</p>
<p>If you're talking about Phantom Menace, you were taught right.</p>
<p>Telegram.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's urgent.</p>

<p>Everyone's gonna know I'm a liar.</p>
<p>Help me.</p>
<p>Oh, Britta.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story about a friend of mine that everyone called a liar.</p>
<p>His name was Bernie Madoff.</p>
<p>Pierce, he was a liar.</p>
<p>He stole billions of dollars from his clients.</p>
<p>Has this been confirmed? Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I Britta'd it.</p>
<p>Bernie? Oh, hi, Shirley.</p>
<p>Hello, Annie.</p>
<p>Abed seems to be having a good time, which is all that matters.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Looks like he made the right choice.</p>
<p>He certainly did.</p>
<p>So we agree.</p>
<p>The best woman won.</p>
<p>She certainly did.</p>
<p>He's on two dates, isn't he? He certainly is.</p>
<p>This is the most fun I've ever had on a work-study gig.</p>
<p>And I used to run the frozen-yogurt machine before that guy broke it.</p>
<p>Many close calls.</p>
<p>Keep forgetting details, using the wrong names, having to duck behind plants.</p>
<p>Aah! This night has been perfect.</p>
<p>Oh, what else is on the list? Oh.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>If this were a movie, this would be the part where we kiss.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Except we're doing a sitcom trope, so it'd be totally out of place.</p>
<p>Time to go get caught and make a plea to the girl I like.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go with Jessica.</p>
<p>She seems to be the audience favorite.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>I'd rather die -- And I knew -- And I knew -- Uh-oh.</p>
<p>You thought you'd get away with this? Let me explain.</p>
<p>What about wanting to grow? Was that a lie so you could do another world-famous Abed TV adventure? These are real people you're messing with.</p>
<p>Kat is hula-hoping all by herself.</p>
<p>Abed, in the real world, people can actually get hurt.</p>
<p>Message for the party.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>So I got a request for, "You suck at this. Get off the stage." </p>
<p>Okay, I don't know if that's the band or the song.</p>
<p>Again, apologies.</p>
<p>Changnesia.</p>
<p>Ha-ha.</p>
<p>Well, it blew up in my face in a slightly different way than I planned.</p>
<p>Can I help you? Where's Rachel? She said she had to go.</p>
<p>Where? I don't know.</p>
<p>She seemed upset.</p>
<p>She ran out of here without tagging half this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, whose water wings are these? Aah! Come back here.</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>
<p>My baby loves me I know.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I did mean what I said about growth.</p>
<p>But you were both so intent on getting me dates, I couldn't help myself.</p>
<p>It was wrong, and hurtful.</p>
<p>I see that now.</p>
<p>Well, maybe setting you up was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess neither of our girls were really right for you.</p>
<p>The worst part is I met a girl tonight that I really do like.</p>
<p>I was busy chasing one trope, I missed one under my nose, that the girl I liked all along was under my nose.</p>
<p>I've screwed things up.</p>
<p>I don't know if I can make them right.</p>
<p>Aw-- Wait.</p>
<p>This one's real, right? Yeah, I'm really sad.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Well, go find her, dummy.</p>
<p>Yeah, haven't you ever seen a movie? Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>I hate to say I told you so, but I'm gonna say it to Britta's face.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>Sophie.</p>
<p>What is the nature of hope? Sophie's not coming, guys.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>Looks like someone underestimated the time it takes to plan a dance.</p>

<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>I'm <span class="ref"><span class="reference people">Sophie B. Hawkins</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005001">Sophie B.

<p>I think you know this one.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p># That old dog has chained you up #</p>
<p># All right #</p>
<p># Give you everything you need #</p>
<p># To live inside a twisted cage #</p>
<p># Sleep beside an empty rage #</p>
<p># Did you do this? #</p>
<p># If it's possible to make something happen by willing it, then yes, I did. #</p>
<p># Damn, I wish I was your lover #</p>
<p># I'd rock you till the daylight comes #</p>
<p># Make sure you are smiling and warm #</p>
<p># I am everything #</p>
<p># Tonight I'll be your mother #</p>
<p># I'll do such things to ease your pain #</p>
<p># Free your mind #</p>
<p># And you won't feel ashamed #</p>
<p>I -- oh sorry, Sophie.</p>
<p>I have something to say.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>There was a girl here tonight.</p>
<p>Her name was Rachel.</p>
<p>I met her, and it was very pleasant.</p>
<p>And I made a mistake.</p>
<p>And now I'd very much like to continue this conversation in private.</p>
<p>Wow, viva lost love.</p>
<p>Damn, I wish I was your lover I'd rock you till the daylight comes You came back.</p>
<p>That was pretty embarrassing.</p>
<p>H had fi@: But I'm glad I did it.</p>
<p>So would you like to go out sometime? I would like that.</p>
<p>Wanna pretend you're just going outwith me on a bet? Oh, I'd like that very much.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>But maybe we should try normal first.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>I prefer "As I Lay Me Down." </p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>You come inside my jungle book I can't believe she pulled this off.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>According to dean law, I must now give her my amulet.</p>
<p>What? Hm? Well, she had a little help from a wise old man who was the official supplier of moist towelettes to the Lilith Fair between 1997 and 1999.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>You're safe.</p>
<p>You did this? But why? Because in the face of all logic and reason, Britta didn't back down.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Also, I didn't like you being a jerk to her.</p>
<p>She was acting crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what choice did she have? You make fun of her, you use her name as a synonym for screwing up.</p>
<p>Cut her some slack, Jeff.</p>
<p>She helped you reconcile with your dad.</p>
<p>For Pete's sake, let her be happy.</p>
<p>It felt like springtime On this February morning In the courtyard Birds were singing your praise I know it's probably impossible to read my texts without them sounding sarcastic, but I assure you, this one is as earnest as they come.</p>
<p>Congratulations on an awesome dance.</p>
<p>You Britta'd the hell out of this thing.</p>
<p># This I pray #</p>
<p># That you will hold me dear #</p>
<p># As I lay me down to sleep #</p>
<p># This I pray #</p>
<p># That you will hold me dear #</p>
<p># Though I'm far away #</p>
<p># I'll whisper your name #</p>
<p># Into the sky #</p>
<p>Can you do one where you wish you had ice cream?</p>
<p>Damn, I wish I had some ice cream --</p>
<p>Ah! So good.</p>
<p>Okay, can you do one where you wish I was <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Batman</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895">Batman</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1989&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Action</span><span class="tag genre">Adventure</span></span></span></span>?

<p>Damn, I wish Abed was <span class="ref"><span class="reference titles">Batman</span><span class="popup"><span class="label"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895">Batman</a></span><span class="titleType">movie</span><span class="years">1989&ndash;</span><span class="genres list"><span class="tag genre">Action</span><span class="tag genre">Adventure</span></span></span></span>, I love it so much.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>All right, you guys are taking advantage of Ms. B. Hawkins.</p>
<p>But-- But-- But you nothing, she's an artist.</p>
<p>She is not here to do your bidding.</p>
<p>Heh-heh-heh.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Now, if you could just sing "Dean, I Wish I Was Your Lover" with these new lyrics.</p>
<p>It's for my voice-mail.</p>
<p>Who's Jeff Winger? Just sing the damn song.</p>
